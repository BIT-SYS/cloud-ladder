Toy Story (1995)$
What a wonderful integration of classic toys and a superb plot. It's a new height in animation (though things have gotten even more impressive long since). The voicings of Tim Allen as Buzz and Tom Hanks as Woody, with their inherent connection to their toy beings, with an incredible supporting cast, make this a romp to end all romps. There is a strain between the realities of the world and the fact that even though they are sentient beings, they are still toys. Buzz has lights that flash but he can't really fly. Woody has the ludicrous string on his back that allows him to deliver his catch phrases. Then there is the neighborhood villain, Sid, who is a maimer and destroyer of toys. There is the quest for the mishandled and lost. And a finale that is worthy of everything that has been set up. What really makes this work is the "humanity" of the characters. There is love and a true connection among them. If you have never seen this, it is worth every minute.$
Toy Story is a sheer delight to view on the screen.  The characters are well done, the plot is exceptional, and the best thing of all, the film is entirely produced on the computer.  The animation is extraordinary in it's ability to bring such great entertainment to the screen.  The film also teaches some good lessons for the kids like friendship (mainly between Woody and Buzz Light-year).  Spectacular entertainment all around and one of the best films Disney has come with.$
This is as close to perfection as any animated film has come, entertained parents on a equal plane with their children, and set the bar to the top of the animation film industry. No film has yet come close to Toy Story in legitimizing animation as a film art on the level of movies with live actors. Great comedies are hard to come by - Toy Story strikes gold on that basis alone, but is so much more. One of the Top 100 Greatest Films of All Time, and currently resides on my "Top 10 Greatest Comedy Films (1960-Present)" list.$
Toy Story is one of my favourite animated films! Even as an adult I can still watch it and be entertained. This film is not only nostalgic but is relatable, emotional and a lot of fun!$
Though I am not a big fan of computer animation,I have to give the folks at Pixar credit.This brand of animation is nothing short of brilliant.The attention to detail,such as eye and body movement is quite remarkable.Computers allow them to make their characters as close to human like as possible,something we have never seen in traditional hand drawn animation,though the latter will always be the closest to my heart.Combine this excellence with a genuinely good story idea and a top notch voice cast and the result is good family entertainment.It's obvious that the people at Pixar are not only caring perfectionists when it comes to film making,but they care about our kids,something rarely seen today.Highly recommended for any home library.$
Toy Story is the film that started Pixar Animated Studios into its long string of never ending success. What Pixar does is not just absorb the younger demographic and keep the older ones mildly entertained. It completely absorbs everyone watching no matter the age or the level of maturity, films of Pixar, starting from Toy Story, have kept a certain magical touch around it with an unexpected amount of depth. Everyone as a child imagines their toys will come alive and go on their own adventures. One of the great things Pixar does is that it does not attract audiences with its overloaded superstar casts but rather with its material. The only superstar here is Tom Hanks and Tim Allen is the next most aforementioned voice over. Unlike what most people think their is an actually a method to casting for animated films as there is to a live-action one. As a result of this Pixar stays faithful to its material and creates a great genuine and warm feeling around the film and its characters.$
Toy Story is just a wonderful film, that I recommend to anyone who loves animation. I will also say that it is definitely the best Pixar movie to date, all of which are extremely good, even the weaker efforts Cars and the Incredibles are well worth watching. I loved the voice talents, the talented Tom Hanks is perfect as Woody, and Tim Allen likewise as Buzz. Both characters are hugely engaging thanks to their frequent conflicts, and are well supported by excellent supporting characters like Potato Head, Rex, Ham and Little Bo Beep, voiced by the likes of Don Rickles, Jim Varney, John Ratzenberger and Annie Potts. Not to mention the hilarious toy aliens, and the creepy kid Sid. The voice talents aren't the only things worth mentioning, the film has a remarkable story and a truly irreverent script ("I'm from Mattel, actually I'm from a smaller company that was purchased by Mattel in a leveraged buyout"). But the best aspect of the movie is the phenomenal animation, which was colourful and sophisticated with brilliant character movement. Honestly, I loved this movie, and I also thought the sequel is one of the few sequels of recent times, that actually manages to surpass its predecessor. All in all, a wonderful film, that is a must-see for the whole family. 10/10 Bethany Cox.$
The first feature length Pixar film and the first feature film to be made entirely in computer animated imagery Toy Story was a milestone in film history. But apart from it's massive impact, Toy Story is still a really great film. The toys in the bedroom of Andy Davis (John Morris) are alive (when Andy doesn't look) and seem to have their own community set up. The most popular toy being Andy's favorite toy, a toy cowboy named Woody (Tom Hanks). But that might change this birthday when Andy get's a new toy named Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen) a toy spaceman who still thinks that he's a real spaceman. To add on to that Woody takes an immediate disliking to Buzz because Andy seems to play with him more now and all the other toys go the same route. Well Woody and Buzz inadvertently end up in the house of Sid Phillips (Erik Von Detten) the destructive next door neighbor who is pretty much the type of person that would put a turtle on it's shell for fun. So Woody and Buzz have to overcome their differences and get back to Andy's house before he moves. This film's story is great and intriguing. The comedy here is also great. The dialog between Woody and Buzz is very funny. I definitely recommend this movie to anyone who hasn't seen it. It's the birthplace of Pixar who over the years have proved themselves worthy of the praise given by adults and children alike.$
I re-watched this for the first time in about 15 years and it still holds up remarkably well. The animation is still very expressive at capturing character, tone and making a believable world unto itself. Pixar would go on to create more polished films but this one has all the hallmarks of the company. The story is enjoyable for children and if parents squint they can see a metaphor in employment turnover. (Not to mention the cultural transition from westerns to sci-fi, or the meta irony of 2d cell animation being supplanted by CGI). The film is equal parts charming, funny and exciting. It even tugs at the heartstrings not matter how cynical you are. It is far from Pixar's best but it holds its own in the pantheon of animated films.$
This was the very first computer animated film from Walt Disney Pictures and Pixar Animation, it is just excellent. It is showing what happens when the young Andy leaves his room, his toys come to life! Woody the cowboy is Andy's favourite toy, and looks after all the other toys (and he is a very good Tom Hanks voicing). Unfortunately on Andy's early birthday party he gets a new favourite toy, Buzz Lightyear the space ranger (voiced by Tim Allen). Woody obviously gets jealous and both him and Buzz end up lost, and then in evil Sid's room. For a kid, Sid is a good villain. Woody and Buzz are now trying to find a way to get back to their owner. Also starring Don Rickles as Mr. Potato Head, John Ratzenberger as Hamm, Wallace Shawn as Rex, Jim Varney as Slinky, Annie Potts as Bo Peep, John Morris as Andy, Scream 2's Laurie Metcalf as Andy's Mom, Full Metal Jacket's R. Lee Ermey as Army Sarge and Jeff Pidgeon as Green Aliens.With recognisable toys for every generation, and the Oscar and Golden Globe nominated song "You've Got a Friend" and Oscar nominated music by Randy Newman, this is a great family film. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen and a Special Achievement Award (fior creation of a feature-length computer-animated film), it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Special Visual Effects, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Comedy/Musical. It was number 5 on The 100 Greatest Family Films, along with the sequel, both was number 4 on The 100 Greatest Cartoons, and it was number 40 on The 100 Greatest Films. Outstanding!$
A wonderfully sculpted piece of filmmaking. It brings us into a new age and may this new age have films that are just as delightfully witty as this pleasing film for all ages. The laughs are constant, there's great creativity at work, from the artists and the numerous talents who lend their voices. Hanks, Allen, Rickles and Ermey stand out in their performances.$

Jumanji (1995)$
I watched this classic in 2021 for the first time. Trust me, I never felt like old boring stuff. It was truly amazing. Nor, after watching the Jumanji movies till now except for this, did I find this one to be similar. It was different. It was Classical. It was a great show. Fantastical Fantasy. Good adventure although latest ones have lot more. However, this, suprised me considering I had made up my mind of what Jumanji could be. But this was truly amazing. Although latest ones have great cast, next level VFX, astounding adventure, this one's the best. I do love the first part of the latest ones that came in 2017, I'd find rather take a tie between the two than selecting one. Thank you. However, lemme tell you, it was leaving Prime, so I watched and it was worth it.$
While I try not to take IMDb ratings to heart, I do think the rating for this film is too low. The film is absolutely fantastic in all departments. I will admit, there are some bits that are quite scary due to some scenes that are amazingly dark. The film does start off slowly, but when the film fast forwards to twenty six years later, the film turns into fast-paced family entertainment. Other than one or two scary scenes and the slow beginning, I could find very little wrong with Jumanji. The story is great, very intriguing and filled with humour, scares and poignancy. The cinematography and scenery are constantly breathtaking, and the special effects are extraordinary. The film is aided by a hilarious and poignant script, spirited direction, atmspheric music and the fact that it goes at a very fast pace. Even the acting was great, with Robin Williams in one of his best performances as Alan Parrish. While he is subtle in places, the director allows him to be funny, which is what he does best. Bonnie Hunt is good too and she and Williams have great chemistry, and Bradley Pierce and Kirsten Dunst are cute and lively. Plus the ending is nice and satisfying. All in all, I love this movie, even with its very minor problems, it is non-stop fast paced family entertainment. 9/10 Bethany Cox$
Jumanji is a fun and creative adventure. The filmmakers were able to expand the source material in a way that enriched the story instead of making it feel watered down. Robin Williams always does a great job playing a grown-up kid and the rest of the cast is solid, as well. This is an intense and entertaining family film.$
I love this movie ! Robin Williams, Kirsten Dunst, Bebe Neuwirth and the animal special effects are incredible. My only complaint is that no attempt was to explain the strange origins of the game as possibly a game that is cursed or an artifact left in our world by the African gods. There are several other plot points that are never answered: why keep returning to the house, and if they know the game is dangerous, why lose it with the pieces included so someone else can play it. I think I'd be leaving the dice and pieces as far away from each other as possible. The whole time-traveling/ renewed time line effect is a minor problem in the plot as is why that hunter wants to kill Daniel(Robin) in the first place. The computerized animal effects are made to act like real animals both charming and mischievous and sinister. The slow degradation of the Parrish house into a jungle and gradually the whole town is a remarkable effect, quite possibly the most elaborate for any movie.$
I really enjoy this film. The only reason that I gave it 9 stars instead of ten was because it slightly scared me and I'm not a huge fan of that. Regardless it's a great film with amazing actors and wonderful message. Makes me miss Robin a lot!$
My only real complaint with Jumanji is where did this game come from? Who created it? I really wish they could have discovered more about the game's past, it's history. Then it would have made a little more sense. But I'm not saying I didn't like it. On the contrary, I do enjoy it very much, I think it's a cool buried treasure. The characters, the story, the effects all perfect. The cast does a great job in this movie and the concept of a strange magical board game works. I wish there was more monster animals. But the man eating plant and the giant spiders is enough to put it on my page. Robin Williams does great in this first monster movie, wish he do more. But that's just me. Anyway, in conclusion ladies and jelly spoons. This is an assume movie and you can do much worse then Jumanji. 8 STARS.$
I decided to watch this movie with my 7 year old boys and absolutely loved it!! The movie is perfect for that age - suspense, thriller, kids, humor, and Robin Williams. I grew up watching him and miss him so much. He is amazing in the movie, and my boys really enjoyed watching it. I had purchased the game so surprised them with it after the movie and we had a fun game night. I highly recommend it for that age. The new Jumanji is geared more towards teenagers and adults with cheesy dialogues just to generate cheap laughs; this one is a classic. I wish they continued making these for kids, because the new ones are definitely not geared towards kids.$
Unlike the game that has it's players being forced to play until it's finish. The movie can be easily turn off people, but it's not that bad of a movie. The CGI is not that great, and the jokes have this very corny humor to them, but getting past that, it's an entertaining film to watch. At least, it kept my attention for the nearly 2 hours. "Jumanji" is loosely based on the Caldecott Medal-winning children's book by Chris Van Allsburg. The basic premise stays the same: a sister and brother find a strange game based on a jungle safari adventure. When they begin playing it, they find they cannot stop, for the characters and events of the game come to life and start creating havoc to their house and life. Only by finishing the game will make it all go away. The different between the movie and the game is the introduction of adult characters, and how the main characters (The children: Peter and Judy Shepard) on the book are now supporting cast. The movie starts out in 1969, young Alan Parrish discovers a mysterious board game, he doesn't realize its unimaginable powers, until he is magically exile before the eyes of his friend, Sarah, into the untamed jungles of Jumanji. The things that come out of Jumanji are just overblown fears of what a jungle might hold for a uneducation person. Some of the things are just not that common in a jungle settling such as earthquakes, man-eating vines, and certain animals. They cut some things such as the volcano based on the book, from the movie. 26 years later he is freed from the game's spell by two unsuspecting children Judy (Kirsten Dunst) and Peter (Bradley Pierce) playing the same game. Makes you wonder what happens if its Alan turn and no body has rolled a 5 or an 8 in the game at all or a player dies. There is a plot-hole right there. Robin Williams plays the adult Alan whom rapid-fire humor makes him the most eccentric personality ever. He is great, but in this film, he's more kept back from going too crazy. It's gives the character depth so they can focus more on the story. Alan find out the world he used to know as a child, is gone as a adult. There is a very powerful nostalgia feel to the film that shows how much him being missing has effect the community. Alan reunites with Sarah (Bonnie Hunt), the young girl he play the game with in 1969. Hunt as Sarah both funny and appealing. She afraid of everything, but able to show strength when needed. She is not the damsel in distress all the time, her character is pretty believable. Together with the kids try to finish the game before more people get hurt.The producers wanted to make something of this Oedipal angle - Alan, Sarah and the kids form somewhat a makeshift nuclear family - but it's haphazard, forced and totally overwhelmed by the spectacle. The truth is they could have lick their wounds and stop playing, and never finish it and still have great lives. The CGI was great for the day for the animals action scenes. The stampede, the monkeys and others might look badly done today, but it's doesn't hurt the film too bad. Sadly, the film lacks a Jurassic Park realish feel CGI to it, some of the animals, you can totally see where they distorted the UV mapping. Some things saving this movie is the fantastic music score. James Horner did a amazing job on it. The Jumanji drums are just chilling to hear, and the visual of the games first showing up with that sound are creepy. Another character that gives fresh air to the movie is Van Pelt (Jonathan Hyde), a villain man-game hunter from Jumanji who quest is to kill Alan. Jonathan Hyde play as both Alan's dad and the hunter in the film. There seems to be a thematic thing than purely to cut costs in casting. It's like it's represent the conflict between the ideas of his father and the son. Alan argument with his father about attending a boarding school, and about facing the bullying he suffer in school. It wasn't until the Jumanji, that Alan was able to grow up to be a man and face all his fears, even his father. It was the most dangerous game type of chase between them that borderline like a Richard Connell's novel. Another supporting character was Carl Bentley (David Alan Grier) a hapless shoemaker-turned-police officer who gives the movie interesting comedy humor when bad thing happen to his car and him. Director Joe Johnston was hired due to his ILM background, and the film was really trying to improve the special effects and visual effects department, but it's didn't live up to that. Certain visual effects like the animatronic spiders, and the robotic vine flower come out looking like puppets. The effects are clever but mildly disappointing; the creatures' movements have a hint of '50s-style Harryhausen puppet animation. Some children might find the film scary, will prove unnerving to small children, though violence per se is not a factor. Parents ought to consider keeping away children younger than 5. The movie is still a good movie for children, and still holds its hold. So check it out, and play the game.$
Another of my favorite childhood movies, there is Jumanji,one of my favorite movies with Robin Willians and Kirsten Dunst. Alan Parrish is a rich boy and his family were the founders of the city of New England, where the boy and his family lives. Not only that, his father is a businessman who has lots of deals and one of them is the notable shoe factory. But Alan life is not so good as we think: he is having problems with her best friend Sarah's boyfriend and his gang and his father wants to send him to a boarding school. Angry, he says to his father that he is never going to talk to him again and will ran away from his home. But when Alan was going to scape from his house, his friend Sarah goes to his house to talk, and they end up playing the mysterious game called Jumanji that Alan found buried. The strange game starts, and many strange things like wild animals start to show up, until Alan enter the game and be confined there until the results of the dice be 5 or 8. Sarah, too afraid to continue playing,run away. After 26 years,two brothers named Judy and Peter found the game and start playing it, like Sarah and Alan 26 years ago. Peter takes 5 in the dice, what makes Alan turn back after many years. Now they need to finish the game in order to all the horrible results end, but first Alan needs to find Sarah and convince her to play the spooky game again.$
The hauntingly beautiful illustrations of the children's book are animated in this unique adventure for the entire family.  Artistic at each turn this movie is probably not meant for those who have spent more time watching Star Wars than at the library.  At least one reviewer could not understand why the computer images were not as "realistic" as in other computer generated animated films.  That would be like asking why Roger Rabbit does not look like a real rabbit. They are not supposed to be real.  The characters of Jumanji have literally popped out of the children's illustrations full of life and imagination. Similar to Roger Rabbit it meshes two different worlds together.  Have fun. Read the book.  Watch the movie.  Play the game.$

Grumpier Old Men (1995)$
Some people see this as an inferior sequel to the first movie "Grumpy Old Men". I don't agree, i love the first one but i think this one is every bit as good and in some ways..even better than the original. Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon are my favorite comedy team. The Fortune Cookie is a classic and i also love "Buddy Buddy" and "The Odd Couple Parts 1 and 2 but the Grumpies hold a special place in my heart. I was personally hoping for another Grumpy movie but sadly we've lost both of these wonderful stars so that will never happen. At least we will always have these fine films to enjoy and treasure. I have them on Dvd and watch them regularly..they never fail to touch my heart and make me smile.$
Nothing's different in this lovely follow up to the sleeper hit original. Lemmon and Matthau still jab at each other while Sophia Loren practically steals the film with her still astonishing beauty. Things only get better with age.$
This movie is downright hilarious with tons of good one-liners. Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon (may they both rest in peace) are two of the funniest actors in history. No one else could have played Max &amp; John. Sophia Loren is still one of the most beautiful women in movie history! One of the funniest scenes is when she says "Holy moly" after being kissed by Max. Watch this movie. You will enjoy it, if you have a sense of humor!$
It's just possible that the intention was to shoot four Grumpy Old Men titles featuring the four seasons because after the Winter setting of the first one we are now in Summer though theoretically such a cycle should have begun with Spring and ended with Winter so maybe the cyclical thing was an afterthought. Whatever we have virtually the same cast doing virtually the same thing with one absentee and two replacements one of which, Anna Guilbert is actually a native of Minneapolis adding a touch of authenticity. If it was unrealistic that Ann Margaret - who, after all, was teaching English at university and would by definition have access to dozens of eligible males - would marry Jack Lemmon in the first film it is equally unrealistic that Sophia Loren would wed Walter Mattheau here other than for feelgood reasons. On the other hand it's probably churlish to nitpick in this way when the film is only intended to entertain. Which it does.$
Jack Lemmon, Walter Matthau, Ann-Margret, Sophia Loren, Kevin Pollack, Daryl Hannah and Burgess Meredith star in this 1995 comedy sequel. This takes place about 6 months later where John (Lemmon) is now married to Ariel (Margret) and he and Max (Matthau) are sort of getting along. This time, Max finds romance when he meets Maria Ragetti (Loren), an Italian widow who moves into town and opens a restaurant. Jacob (Pollack) and Melanie (Hannah) are also engaged and things start to get a bit difficult for them which makes their dads feud with each other, but only temporarily. The late, Meredith (Rocky) also returns as John's father and this was his final film. This is a good sequel and like the first film, it provides laughs and a bit of heartfelt moments as well. I recommend this.$
Woeful, disappointing sequel to 1993's hit "Grumpy Old Men" is more retread than follow-up. The two crotchety neighbors--Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon--bicker over their children (who will soon be making the sparring oldsters in-laws!) and, of course, who has the better fishing skills. They stop trading insults long enough for Matthau to begin irritating a new woman in town, a fiery Italian who has just opened her own restaurant. Sitcom humor with a sometimes-raunchy twist that is no longer fresh. Almost worth-seeing for Sophia Loren's funny, lively performance, but everyone else looks a little sleepy. Ann-Margret (who married Lemmon's character at the end of the original) must've dropped in for a day and a half to complete her work. As the youthful couple, Kevin Pollack and Daryl Hannah are also under-used. ** from ****$
Max Goldman (Walter Matthau) and John Gustafson (Jack Lemmon) are still combative while maintaining their truce. John is married to Ariel (Ann-Margret) now and his father (Burgess Meredith) is still spry. Everybody is chasing after the big fish Catfish Hunter. Meanwhile, their children Melanie (Daryl Hannah) and Jacob (Kevin Pollak) are planning to get married. Newcomer Maria Ragetti (Sophia Loren) arrives in Wabasha to buy the bait shop and turn it into an Italian restaurant. It's a continuation that's missing much of the fun. It is contrived. It's great to see these great actors working together but that's all I got out of it. I found very few laughs.$
This movie just happens to be yet another installment of an endearingly hilarious story. The chemistry between Messrs Matthau and Lemmon has been obvious since their earlier days in "The Odd Couple" and seems to have gotten even better as the years ensued. The acting is superb, the direction impeccable, the entire cast is phenomenal and with the addition of "Maria" and her mom it simply completes the entire storyline to make for one whale of a good time. The innate beauty of both Ms. Margret and Ms. Loren is timeless. Burgess Meredith's role has been stepped-up from his previous one, as the cynical, openly opinionated, Lothario wannabe, lol, a resounding achievement for a gentleman of his longevity, yet he pulls it off famously. There is some really hilarious banter between him and Maria's mother "Mama Ragetti", I laughed out loud. I must confess, I laughed out loud at so many of the scenes in this film, I can't even begin count them. There is a real synergy to this movie, a compilation of comedic moments. I can't imagine how anyone wouldn't enjoy this movie. I'm "hooked"...$
Grumpier Old Men is one of the cutest movies I have ever seen. It is a fitting follow - up to Grumpy Old Men. Matthau and Lemmon shine in this great film. My favorite performance in this film would have to go to the wonderful actress Sophia Loren who plays a feisty newcomer in town. Burgess Meredith is marvelous in his role, and he had me rolling! This film is excellent, and I am proud to own it. I suggest that anyone looking for a lots of laughs, and a cute romance story see this movie.$

Waiting to Exhale (1995)$
This was a good movie, even though I'm not the target audience.  It's nice to see that black women had a movie about them, and thanks to the star power of Whitney Houston it became no.1 and was a big hit.  I am actually tired of reading little comments saying that Whitney isn't that good of an actress because all of those comments are based on the fact that she's a singer.  If she wasn't a famous singer, nobody would say anything bad about her acting. IMO, she acted very well just like in all her movies, she's not an oscar caliber actress (very few are) but she definitely has screen presence, charisma and gets the job done.  Stop hating her because she's a singer, unlike Madonna or Mariah, Whitney at least did some quality work with some quality people, and she hasn't had flops &amp; horrible movies.$
I read some of the other comments comcerning this movie. And personally i thought that this movie was greatly misinterpreted. This movie (while have some "man-bashing" elements) is more about the friendship of four strong real black women who represent a little part of most women in society. I love this movie. I think that it has humor, depth, and presents a very real perspective on love and dating in today's world. And while men might take offense to the representation of the male gender in this movie, I think that it's important to realize that unfaithful, self-absorbed men do exist. However, as we must acknowledge the less moral men of our society, this movie also portrays that good decent men are not a figment of our imagination. With Wesley Snipes and Gregory Hines characters, we see that men are not all callous unfeeling creatures. So basically, I feel that this movie is one to be appreciated and enjoyed. (And in response to one respone that i read. . . One does not CHOOSE who they fall in love with, love just happens. We cannot choose who we love.) Anyways. . .i loved the part where she burned all the clothes too :)$
I got an opportunity to see Waiting To Exhale for the second time recently, the first time shortly after it came out, and now now. I can't say time has improved my thoughts of the film, which is odd, as I seemed to recall really enjoying this the first time it came out. (Maybe I should watch 'Homeward Bound' again, as I LOVED that movie the first time I saw it) The only actress really to impress in this movie is of course the amazing Angela Bassett who growls and hisses every chance she gets! I really liked this character, and I felt for the trials she was going through. The other character I liked was the one played by Loretta Devine, who was cute as the overweight mother who unexpectedly falls in love. I kind of thought the Lela Rachon character was underwritten, and seemed to almost revel in her wantonness. lol. As for Miss Houston, when I was watching her "act", well, Chesty Morgan's performance in "Deadly Weapons" came to mind for some odd reason, as it appears the acting thing was becoming a struggle, and wasn't going to last for too long.. All in all, I wasn't really disappointed in the film, it just slid off...$
While this movie truly is bound to be more appealing to women than men, it is a touching story of four best friends. How they stick together and grow together through life's mistakes, joys, and bad taste in men. I love Angela Bassett and she is outstanding in this movie. The other 3 ladies, Whitney,Lela, and Loretta do great jobs too. This movie is filled with sweet moments, great laughter, and maybe some tears. Just a wonderful movie that shows what friendship is about. I have not read the book, but I have heard many times that the book is better... but hey thats true for almost every book turned movie. So all I know is I love this movie, and every time I watch it, it gives me great pleasure. Not too mention the soundtrack is fabulous! Whitney, Brandy, Babyface,Faith Evans,and Mary J Blige make the music in the film absolutely great.$
Predictable, full of every soppy sad tragic story you've seen on the soaps. You know who is going to sleep with whom, you know they shouldn't, you know what the outcome will be. You could write the dialogue yourself, if you've ever seen even a week's worth of soap operas. You either want to leave the room, or turn the channel, it's so soppy and predictable. Of course they all turn out to be strong women in the end; it was written during that era. Of course 99% of the men are jerks; it was written during that era. Of course all the women are fantastically beautiful; you wouldn't put up with this movie if they looked like real, every-day women. The saddest thing about the movie is how beautiful Whitney Houston used to be before drugs and her husband ruined her.$
As a middle-aged man, I found this to be one of the most ridiculous films I've seen in some time. It's basically two hours of one dimensional portrayals of men by women complaining of being seen as one-dimensional by men. One fairly long scene in one of the characters' living room in which they all state their opinions of men flabbergasted me; why would any self-respecting man WANT any of these whining, narcissistic victims in the first place? Performances aside (except for Angela Bassett, who was totally wasted by never changing her angry expression throughout the whole film), the effort is pretty badly written, and the constant message of "those bad, bad males" starts to become tiring after awhile. I didn't find these women "strong..." I found them very entitled and, as another reviewer put it, self-absorbed. I don't think there was one male character in the film who was portrayed sympathetically or in a three-dimensional manner. It's interesting to me that when films like this come out portraying women in the same way, there's quite a brouhaha; when the tables get turned, it's "groundbreaking."$
This story is relatable to whom? Plot is a snore, but setting the car and clothes on fire was cool.$
Whitney houston...no longer with us. Angela bassett, nominated for what's love got to dowith it. Loretta devine. Lela rochon. The girls stick together when their guys and jobs don't work out. They set the ex's car on fire. And sell all hubby's belongings at a $ 1.00 sale. Their lives are all in turmoil, so they are leaning on each other. Then one day, gloria meets marvin, the next door neighbor. And he's different than the men she has known... gregory hines... sadly, also no longer with us. It's a really good film. Good back stories for everyone involved. An old flame, played by Dennis Haysbert the allstate guy, comes back into savannah's life. Now she has a decision to make. Funny moment when whitney houston complains about the musica they are playing, and she sang some of the songs used in the film! Based on the book by terry mcmillan; looks like she writes stories about women starting over. Directed by forest whitaker, who won the oscar for last king of scotland.$
The love lives of four women over the course of one year that ignores almost every other aspect of their lives, consequently reducing them to one-dimensional character sketches, and that would have its' audience believe that all men are a***holes (unless their wife has died, or is in the process of dying). Well-made and acted, but too loosely plotted to engage, and sorely lacking a sense of humour.$
This movie is awful! The caracters are shallow and almost ridiculous, especially Lela Rochon. It's a very, very, very bad soap opera. I was watching this movie with my wife and we were laughing almost all the time. It is much too long, with no rhythm with absolutely no emotions. It is only a poor attempt to manipulate the viewer by using one cliché after another. Skip it, it's a waste of time!$
It had some laughs, but overall the motivation of the characters was incomprehensible. Why should they be mad at men for cheating when they sleep with all sorts of married men themselves? Very hypocritical. Their lives are messed up because they messed them up with stupid choices. I had no empathy for any of these women.$
This film brought me to tears not because it was so emotional I had to cry but being a Black man and a working actor making a living for 20 + years, It was the first time a big budget, well shot, well acted (Whitney is still weak at times), well directed film about "most" black lives got a big theatrical release. Most black films (Excluding Spike Lee) are about thugs or are so low budget you never get to see them. It was about time!$
Waiting to Exhale (1995) is currently available on Tubi and tells the tale of a group of friends that get back together again when one of them is going through to tumultuous divorce. All of their love lives have struggles but getting together sharpens their lens to take the next step forward in life and for peace of mind. This movie is directed by Forest Whitaker (Hope Floats) and stars Whitney Houston (The Bodyguard), Angela Bassett (Strange Days), Loretta Devine (Crash), Lela Rochon (Any Given Sunday) and Gregory Hines (Running Scared). This film does a magnificent job showing the world from the strong black female perspective. The film does a great job highlighting challenges, vulnerability, strength and drive. The cast delivers outstanding performances and the script was well written and the delivery was perfection. The soundtrack is also legendary. This film has one of the most awkward sex scenes I ever saw. Definitely made me cover my face and cringe. 😂 The men in this are all appropriately awkward and terrible - every line by the men is painful. Overall this is a triumphant movie with a great story that is a must see film. I'd score this a 10/10 and consider it an American motion picture masterpiece.$
This wasn't a bad movie. The acting was great (although Whitney Houston still seems mediocre). Some of the scenes were powerful and funny. However, unlike the book which also deals with the sisterhood of Black women, the movie becomes a long "Men are pigs" tirade that gets weary after a while. Plus it's sometimes hard to root for the characters. For instance, considering all the one-night stands Savannah has, it's hard to see why she's questioning her ability to find a good man. Overall, Waiting to Exhale, is basically a sorely-needed bonding movie for African-American women that, while a little biased, is good escapist fun.$

Father of the Bride Part II (1995)$
As much as I want to rag this movie, make fun of it, call it all kinds of names, belittle it, mock it and otherwise totally trash it, I can't and that is for one reason: Steve Martin. Mr. Martin saves this movie from cinematic oblivion, allows this movie to survive, function and prosper. He is proof that an actor can save a sorry script, can raise the level of a story, can make a movie watchable. Mr. Martin proves once again that he is arguably the finest comedy actor today. He can take the dumbest line and make it sound brilliant; he can take the most insipid scene and raise it to the level of comedy or drama. Kudos to Steve Martin for his sterling performance. As for the other star, Diane Keaton, her performance is wonderful too, but it is Mr. Martin who carries this movie and once again proves that he is the star.$
I enjoyed this film, as I did Father of the Bride (1991), though I had to suspend my credulity a lot. This film was less realistic than the film it was based on, Father's Little Dividend (1951), with Spencer Tracy and Elizabeth Taylor.  For example, it's unlikely that George Banks, a highly successful business owner who obviously must think through his decisions, would be so impetuous as to sell the house he loves and end up having to buy it back at a significant mark-up. (George and Nina decide to sell following a rainstorm that caused their kitchen ceiling to leak, even though the house had two storeys above it.) The new baby *wing* which the Banks then decide to build on to their repurchased home is equally ridiculous, since the house is already huge and only young son Matty is still at home. Between the ill-conceived house sale and repurchase, the posh baby wing and the lavish baby shower, featuring storks flown in from Austria, I don't think George Banks could possibly have spent more money. In the previous film, Father of the Bride (1991), Bryan's parents were portrayed as wealthy, but George is clearly a millionaire himself. I did enjoy this movie -- it's funny, romantic and very warm, with beautiful sets -- but  I would have preferred a little less over-the-top consumerism.$
I have watched this film loads since i have been a child. I love it!!! It's emotional and hilarious!! George and Frank absolutely crack me up but everyone does a great job in their roles. I like number 2 more than number 1 but both great films. A definate must see film!$
as sequels go,this is film isn't too bad.i didn't think ti was quite as good as the first one,but it's not a bad effort.i didn't find it as funny,and some of Steve Martin's histrionics are old and seem forced a bit too me.really,this one doesn't quite have the same sincerity as the first.through much of this movie,i was all too aware i was watching a movie,whereas with firs tone,i was drawn in,and less aware i was watching a movie with people acting.having said that,there are some bright spots.for,one,this movie is just as touching as the first.and Eugene levy has a great cameo.and there is still some fun to be had.even though this may seem too high a rating after much of what i said above,i still think Father of the Bride II is a 7/10$
I love this movie. Like the first one, does not dissapointed me. I think every girl that has good relationship with her father and it's starting her own life without her parents should watch the movie. It is so heart warming. I don't have good relationship with my father and this movie just makes me think- what would it be if i had it . It makes me cry, it makes my laugh. Steve Martin is such an amazing actor.$
This movie is as thin as you can get. Its' emotions are easily played. There are no surprises. It is very predictable. And I say...so what? What is wrong with that? This is an American Dream movie. Everything goes perfectly and everyone is as happy as can be. Why should it be a complicated character study? It deals with the birth of babies. There's no complex feelings that need to be dealt with in this situation. A life is being created. A family is being blessed. A baby's birth is a time for love and hope. This movie has both in spades. It's a very positive movie that shows the joy a new baby brings. Every parent-to-be should watch it. A child's birth is an emotional event with no equal. This movie knows it and milks it for all its' worth. My only complaint is it should have been called Parents of the Bride. Way too much time is spent with the relationship between Steve Martin and Diane Keaton. There should have been more attention paid to Kimberly Williams. Not only were the scenes between her and Martin the best scenes in this and the original, but Kimberly Williams is the most beautiful actress to come out of Hollywood in many years. Forget all the blond, silicone filled, bimbos that every teenage boy raves about. Ms. Williams is a natural beauty that is a true role model for all young girls. She, and her character, is beautiful, intelligent, and has a heart of gold. Had her relationship with Martin been more focused, this sequel would have surpassed the original. While it doesn't do that, it is still a perfect film for the entire family to watch. *** out of ****.$
After seeing this movie countless numbers of times I still laugh and cry and just have the most wonderful feeling at the end. The first time I saw this movie I thought it was OK...but didn't like it as much as the first movie. After a few years I saw it again and absolutely fell in love with it. Now it has become one of my favorite movies and whenever I'm in a bad mood I can pop it in and smile all the way to the finish. Steve Martin is just the funniest man and watching his character change from hating the idea of being a grandpa and new father again never ceases to amaze me. The only thing I hated about that movie was that it had to end. I want to see more!!!! Each character did a great job and that has to be my dream house. If you want a feel good movie that leaves you happy and complete please don't miss this.$
I thought the movie was quite funny, especially scenes like Martin Short doing a workout with the pregnant mother and daughter...that was really great!  Martin Short is basically one of the highlights of the movie...his accent is so weird and funny that you have to love him.  Steve Martin was also good, and I liked his reactions to everything.  Overall, the flick was better than the first one, and cute.  But after awhile, Steve Martin gets a bit annoying with his obsessing over the pregnant women.$
FATHER OF THE BRIDE PART II, in my opinion, is one of the most hilarious, heart-warming, and enchanting comedies I have ever seen. If you ask me, Alan Silvestri's score was absolutely romantic. In addition, I thought that the performances were superior, the directing was excellent, the costumes were perfectly designed, and the casting was perfect. Also, I was surprised that Martin Short sported his accent again. Kudos to Charles Shyer and everyone involved for a job well done. Now, in conclusion, if you are a fan Steve Martin, Diane Keaton, or Martin Short, or if you liked FATHER OF THE BRIDE, I highly recommend this movie. You're in for a feel good time, so see this movie today. You're in for a good time, so go to the video store, rent it or buy it, kick back with a friend, and watch it.$
8/10 - a bit of an absurd premise (although a lot of the best movies benefit from this) but does a good job of keeping the fun energy of its predecessor.$
This one is definitely better than the original, funnier, smoother pace, and in some places, better acting! Plus Martin Short has more screen time. Great! This is a great movie for anyone who like good clean comedy. Awesome! Five out of Five Moose Stars!$
I really enjoyed this movie! It's the kind of movie you can watch over and over and over (trust me, my sister and I watch it tons of times) and never get sick of it! It's funny, and having Steve Martin as George definitely helps. Kimberly Williams is great (as always) and Diane Keaton is good too. I love this more than the first one (Father of the Bride)!$
This movie is a very warm and funny family film. I enjoyed every minute of it because it was very real. Some may disagree but there are a lot of people who may of had this type of situation. I loved that Martin Short was in the Sequel because I love his comedy and he made the movie very funny. The only thing I didn't like was Eugene Levy's character, I found that his part was just put there to extend the movie a bit. I also didn't like how they used him in the second one when he was clearly the one who auditioned to be the wedding singer in the first one. All in all this is a great family film where many will enjoy and watch together.$

Heat (1995)$
This is a brilliant film. While clocking in at a nearly three-hour running time, there isn't a single wasted scene, it is always entertaining and I think it is very rewatchable too. The cinematography, locations and scenery are superb, and the film's atmosphere and pace are also terrific. The story is plausible and beautifully structured with a breathtaking sequence towards the middle of the film, and there are a lot of memorable quotes. Heat is also brilliantly directed by Michael Mann and the acting of Robert DeNiro and Al Pacino is exemplary. So all in all, brilliant and absolutely worth it. 10/10 Bethany Cox$
A brilliant character driven action thriller with drama and emotion all the way. Despite the long runtime, the pacing never drags. The Magic of this action movie is that you believe the people you see in the screen. You care for them and everything they go through. All of the scenes are influential, the script and the score are iconic. Two thumbs up!$
Every 2-3 years i come back to this movie and watch it again and again, just a reminder of the 90's movies with cops and robbers...one of the best cop movie ever!$
Sound like a bold statement? Devotees of classic cops and robbers flicks of old will no doubt take exception, but I believe that Michael Mann achieved some measure of perfection with Heat. To break this three-hour gem of a film down to its core, this is a film about men - strong men - and the supporting role that he women of the film have on them for better or worse. Take Pacino as good cop Vincent Hanna: one of the most intense characterizations of the tragic hero that I have ever witnessed, as he laments the demise of his third marriage to a pill-junkie wife. A fact which he discusses with his archnemesis (De Niro) in what history will regard as one of the most frenetic scenes in the history of film. The dialogue in this scene (at the very end of the first tape, if you own the VHS version) sets up the last half of the film beautifully, as our two rivals come to the joint realization that they have no hand in choosing the paths that will lead them to their ultimate confrontation: their very natures so define their respective actions that any attempt to do otherwise would simply be a waste of time. While I have heard others (who I am ashamed at times to call close friends) say that Heat drags in places, I will concede that there are moments in the film that require more than the cursory attention that they give to the movie they happen to be watching at any given time (I'm sorry not every director is Jerry Bruckheimer), there are poignant developments of character in Heat that many would casually disregard. I am thinking of the interaction between the ex-con who finds conditional employment in a diner with an opportunistic scum of a boss, and whose girlfriend is so proud of him for swallowing his pride and not simply giving the sonofabitch a good pummeling. But there is a catharsis that I felt for that same ex-con when De Niro's character presents him with the opportunity to take just one more score, for old time's sake. Who doesn't feel for this guy - this minor character in a film with big-time heavyweights who gets to shine for a few brief moments. That's what Heat is really: a series of brief moments, some touching, others traumatic, and still others incredibly horrifying in the feelings that they inspire in the romantic who, like me sees not black or white portrayals of protagonist and villain, but a montage of grays that combine to create a vivid spectrum of film characterization that could not be found in hundreds of films combined. One of my five favorite films of all time, Heat is a cinematic banquet of intense imagery and pulse-pounding action. Come hungry.$
I'd give this a 10 if it weren't for the drawn out "climax" and the whole tangent between De Niro and his woman. I understand the necessity of that element, but his character is so indifferent throughout that it lost me completely. That said, about his character, I get it; he isn't supposed to be flamboyant, he's rigid and unforgiving, he lives by a strict creed, and De Niro nails it flawlessly. He just isn't nearly my favorite character. And there's so many to pick from! Heat offers you a slew of people to latch onto, emotionally and empathetically, or even apathetically. Every character showcases his own qualities and flaws, making even the bad guys likable in some cases, but when it comes right down to it they are, clear as day, the bad guys. And all the actors and actresses put on stellar performances. Al Pacino especially; Val Kilmer was a favorite for me, and even Waingro, as despicable a man as he was in the movie, depicted so memorably by Kevin Gage. Even Danny Trejo, who is such a small role, has. Subtle yet powerful performance in the third act. And then there's the action. While the movie is undeniably long, it isn't boring, with the exception of my aforementioned gripe with De Niro's romantic tangent. Aside from that, even when guns aren't blazing (every gunfight is raw and gritty and intensely filmed), there is action to be had. The script is ingenious and cinematography immersive. Have seen multiple times and will watch again in the future.$
One of the most amazing things about Heat is the scale of the film; it is nearly three hours long and packed to bursting with mind-blowing visuals. It seems one of Michael Mann's main priorities was to make a film with a dreamlike feel to it, to portray LA as a dusty oil-painting on which complex characters could play out their lives. One of the main themes is the similarity of the career criminal and the street-wise cop. It is fascinating to find yourself really feeling for DeNiro's tragic bank-robber, a man of philosophical merit who realises he's stuck in a life of crime he doesn't want to lead. Pacino's cop is less easy to sympathise with, but he too leads an in-escapable life of guns and crime. What really stands out is the climax. On the whole, Heat has to be the best cops n' robbers film ever made, indeed, one of the best films. An epic, wonderful, sad, adrenaline-fuelled exercise in scale and grandeur.$
One of the greatest heist movies ever, great movie, classic story, great directing, with a giant legendary cast from a giant acting classic movie 10/10.$
In this exciting thrill ride, good and evil battle it out.  But not in the usual comic-book style of most films today.  "Heat" carries with it the moral values so many of us take for granted.  Although much in the film is morally ambiguous, one may find that even when all your life you've lived on the other side of the law, you can still settle down and have a heart-to-heart.  When I first saw this movie I was sure it would be another violent crime movie that I would never want to see again.  I have since seen it 4 times and have a copy of my own.  The thrilling sequences and brilliant camera-work have you glued to the screen.  The exceptional cast of characters has you wondering "who could be so lucky to work with them?". From the opening scene to the thrilling final scenes and everything in between (including the climax) "Heat" grabs you and pulls you in.  This is a true film masterpiece.$
Really miss great movies like this, its a shame I have to watch my old dvds as modern cinema just isn't what it used to be. Come on Hollywood, stop with the politics and get back to making blockbuster movies like this one.$
For a film to survive almost three hours it has to have some pretty special chemistry and ingredients. While the tale told is full of holes and leaps of faith it's saved by two outstanding performances by De Niro and Pacino. The supporting cast members provide a trivial sideshow in comparison and, were anyone else to have taken the leads, this would be a long gone forgotten B movie, instead, it's a raging, violent and destructive psychotic volcano.$

Sabrina (1995)$
Romantic is the word for this movie.  The story, the settings, everything adds up to romantic. And it's clean - no gratuitous sex scenes or foul language!  A rarity for a 90s movie.  This movie has a timeless quality to it, and part of the reason is the (again) extremely romantic score!  Many critics panned this version of "Sabrina", unfairly comparing it to the original Audrey Hepburn "Sabrina".  Nobody could ever compare to Audrey Hepburn, but Julia Ormond is a fine Sabrina in her own right.  She makes the transition from awkward teen to glamorous woman with subtlety and grace. Greg Kinnear shows a natural flair for acting in his first major movie role.$
The temptation to compare it with the 1954 version is not small. And it is a good thing because the film has the force to use its voice. Julia Ormond is realy Sabrina. And Harrison Ford is a revelation as Linus. But, for me, the authetic good points are Miriam Colon as lovely Rosa and Nancy Marchand as wise,fascinating Maude Larrabee. Short, a seductive film.$
...even worse. The problem with both is, What does the chauffeur's daughter SEE in David? At least in the original there was William Holden. But Greg Kinnear doesn't have that kind of sexual power -- indeed, he's not much of anything. The storyline was silly in the Fifties, and sillier in the Nineties. And given the age differences of the leads, the whole thing is slightly creepy. I have no idea why anyone thought this would make a good remake.$
SABRINA, in my opinion, is a sweet, heartwarming, and charming romance with terrific performances. If you ask me, the way that Sabrina (Julia Ormond) and David (Greg Kinnear) met up again after several years was very romantic. It was also really funny when a ménage à trois began after Linus (Harrison Ford) fell for her, too. As far as I can see, this movie had terrific performances, excellent direction, perfect casting, and nice scenery, especially for a movie set in New York. Oh, yes, the Paris scenery was especially lovely. In conclusion, if you are a fan of Harrison Ford, Julia Ormond, or Greg Kinnear, you should definitely see this movie. Prepare for lots of charm, wit, laughs, and romance when you see it.$
Sabrina contains about every cliché you could possibly imagine: an apparently dowdy young woman undergoing a makeover whilst abroad and returning home looking stunning; a young playboy who the girl has always loved initially failing to recognise her with her new look then pursuing her romantically; the overly-serious older brother using the girl in a plan to achieve his business ends then realising that he really does love her; the younger brother proving at the end that he's not so dumb after all - the list of stereotypes could go on and on. However having said all that, when such a seemingly familiar film is as well made and as beautifully scripted and acted as Sabrina, it's hard not to be swept along with it and to enjoy every minute. I loved the performances here, particularly from Harrison Ford and Julia Ormond. I've never seen Ford play such a staid, uncharismatic character as Linus before but I get the impression from watching the film that he enjoyed the opportunity to take on this kind of part. Ormond makes an extremely engaging leading lady, perfect for the role of Sabrina. I particularly enjoyed Sabrina's mirthful reaction to seeing Linus put on the baseball cap while he's trying to win her affection. Also very funny was Linus' effortless recognition of the new-look Sabrina thus revealing her identity to a confused David. John Willliams also contributes a nice score. This is a classy romantic comedy, well worth watching.$
Harrison Ford takes on the Humphrey Bogart role in the Sidney Pollack remake of Billy Wilder's 1954 SABRINA. Greg Kinnear plays his younger brother, and Julia Ormond plays Sabrina, the free-spirited daughter of the chauffeur for the massive estate run by Ford and his mommy (Nancy Marchand). Sabrina comes home from a long stay in Paris at an awkward moment for the wealthy family, and it is up to the stuffy, aloof Ford to persuade her to return to Paris. Ford is much too old for his role, although he is very convincing in his portrayal of an obsessed business tycoon. You'd almost think he was appearing in another movie, something involving, say, a murder or kidnaping. Ormond is not nearly appealing as Audrey Hepburn from the original, and in fact she is less appealing than her costar Lauren Holly, who plays a doctor soon to marry Kinnear. So I don't buy that Ford eventually falls for Ormond at all. I also didn't give a hoot about the details of the family business. Kinnear, who is actually pretty funny as Harrison's kid brother, is inexplicably left out of the entire middle of the movie so that it can focus on Ford wooing the confused Sabrina, who thinks she loves Kinnear but then decides she loves Ford. Yuck. Imagine kissing the wrinkly-faced Ford. I would have some fun with Ormond's lackluster performance and undistinguished appearance right about here, but instead let it be said that it simply was a bad idea to remake this film. SABRINA 1995 was not Ormond's fault.$
This adaptation of an almost classic film makes some weird changes and leaves others that look like an anachronism in a world forty years later. It's better to take the new film for what it is and judge it on its own merits and flaws. Sabrina's sojourn in Paris is too brief to remake her and for Paris to become an obsession on her return. How does she land directly into the world of high fashion? It's hard to accept the younger brother's sudden transformation from a playboy into the responsible serious role of his older brother. It happens towards the end just when the plot needs a new direction. Just as his new doctor finance suddenly reappears when needed. She and all the minor characters are just one-dimensional figures. Ford is wellno Bogart but Humphrey wasn't any better in the role either. Julia Ormond, despite the criticism on this forum, is the one bright star. She shines and has a bit of Hepburn quality in her radiance as a grown woman.$
Like Sandra Bullock in "Love Potion #9", Julia Ormond went from being an ugly duckling to a swan and capturing the heart of a wealthy man who had barely noticed her before. But love turned out to be a logjam to big business so a game of high stakes emotional chicanery was launched only to turn out with unintended results. I loved this one: makes me want to see the original.$
Although terribly predictable and a bit too long, this film is kind of sweet. Ford shines as in his typical role of comically aloof and Ormand plays her lead well. Good chemistry and cinematography.$
Young Julia Ormond, the daughter of a servant, is in love with Greg Kinnear but he does not know that she exists. She goes off to Europe and returns. She is now a knock-out beauty in this nice little remake of the original from 1954. Naturally while trying to get Kinnear, Ormond will fall in love with his older brother (Harrison Ford). A nice romantic film that works because of old Hollywood ideas done in a modern, sophisticated way. 4 stars out of 5.$
"Sabrina" 1995 tells of a young chauffeur's daughter (Ormond) who grows up in the shadow of a wealthy family with two eligible bachelors; one all work (Ford) and the other all play (Kinnear).  Forever in love with the latter as a girl, Sabrina studies in Paris and returns years later to the estate and the dreams of her childhood which she must now address as woman. A wistful contemporary Cinderella story with a solid cast and plenty of dreamy John Williams music, "Sabrina" is a must see for all lovers of romantic comedy. B+$
Many won't agree, and the critics may have panned it, but I feel this fantastic , feel-good movie exemplifies what all great movies should be: entertaining , intelligent, thoughtful, with touches of comedy, pathos, and respect for the human condition.. I find myself watching this magnificent work over and over and over, and never tiring of it. I feel Harrison Ford delivers his best performance, bar none, and really shows that he is one our best actors. Julia Ormond: well, what can I say. Just absolutely the most beautiful, sexy, wonderful actress living today... I fall in love with her all over again each time I watch the movie. Greg Kinnear is a very believable co-star and funny, funny... the players are selected very well , each contributing mightily to the final effect! The director really knew what he was doing and keeps the movie going strong.. congratulations to all. I wish there were more works like this, and would really like to see another done with Harrison Ford and Julia Ormond in the title roles, oncemore!. Bravo! Bravo!$

Tom and Huck (1995)$
It's an awful presentation, the original tale isn't much better - who do these injuns think they are acting as if they own the place. Curious that Mark Twain didn't use someone of white western European descent for his antagonist. Sadly makes this and him a statue that belongs in a museum.$
The story was ok, but at some point I have to say that it's allday racism of the 18xx against natives. Natives allways have to be the bad counterpart in such a story. Even black people weren't in a fix like natives. So the story might have been good for the times Mark Twain wrote them - and I rely on the studios correctness to not change the story from Mark Twain too much. I also have too admit that I never read any book of Mark Twain. But if the story goes other way, shame on the studio. Both options are bad, so I won't change my mind about my rating. Offside the racism through native stereotypes, it is a nice movie for kids, not more. I wouldn't show it to kids without teaching them about stereotypes against natives.$
Disney did good but still this version will never compare to the 1970's musical version. "Tom and Huck for a New Generation" is what this movie should have been called. The storyline stays true to the book but there is a modern day mid 90s feel about the relationship between Tom and Huck. Not unlike the old days when Tom and Huck in other filmed versions would simply drop what they were doing to go and play the ultimate prank on their unsuspecting prey.$
I saw Tom and Huck about 15 years ago and I must say It was a Pretty Good Movie. The plot was pretty good about two boys named Tom Sawyer and Hucklberry Finn who go out to find a murder named Injun Joe who murdered the doctor of their town and framed their friend Muff Potter for the crime. The movie was just really great and had a lot of funny scenes in it including the scene where Tom and Huck disguise themselves in mud to hide from Injun Joe. Jonathan Taylor Thomas, whom I think is one of the most gifted child actors ever did a fantastic job playing Tom Sawyer and the late Brad Renfro did a fantastic job as Huck Finn. Both actors bought good performances to their characters and child actress Rachael Leigh Cook I thought did a good job as Tom's love interest Becky Thatcher. And actor Eric Schweig I thought gave a good performance as the villainous Injun Joe. Disney couldn't of cast a better actor to play the role. I say that Tom and Huck is a Great Disney Movie that the whole family must see. I give it a 10 out of 10.$
Tom and Huck isn't a great movie, but it's a good way for kids to be introduced to the characters of Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn. Although it may be a bit intense for children under six, since the plot revolves around a murderer and his plot for revenge. And even though this movie is set in the 1840s, it has a strong 90s feel to it. Whatever happened to Jonathan Taylor Thomas?$
Tom and Huck is a 1995 movie released by Walt Disney Pictures starring Jonathan Taylor Thomas (T.V.'s "Home Improvement", "The Lion King" )and Brad Renfro. It is based from Mark Twain's Novel about two mischievous boys Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn who, after witnessing the murder of Doc Robinson, the town's undertaker by the evil, knife-throwing Injun Joe (who will remind you of Indiana Jones if you've seen it), they must sware in blood not to tell anyone. If they don't, they will remain alive and not die; but, if they do tell anyone it was Injun Joe, he will kill them. The morning after the murder was committed, Injun Joe blames the whole thing on the town drunk, Muff Potter, saying that Muff committed the murder when Tom knows it was Injun Joe. I first saw this movie when I was a kid and recently, I have viewed it over and over again because it is one of my favorite movies. It has everything a good movie (like I have stated in reviews of other movies) should have: awesome music score composed by Stephen Endelman ("The Hunt for Murrell's Map" is a theme that fits the movie perfectly) amazing climax (being set in a huge scary cave, it makes one of the best you'll ever see), and a lesson for both boys; "When a friend's in trouble, you don't run away." One of my favorite parts in the movie is when Tom says "Last week Aunt Polly whipped me for swiping a pie, but it wasn't me. Figured it was Sid." Then Huck replies "He wanted it, but I beat em' to it." Then Tom says "I ought to punch you in the nose." Huck answers "You're welcome to try." Then Tom's says "Maybe later." The only reason I didn't give the film a 10 is because the accents could have been a little bit more country. Other than that, this film was great family fun. Rating: 9/10!$
I read the book and am aware of the liberties they took in adapting this to the screen. With that said, I liked it. I liked the actors who did a great job in their given roles. There were still some funny scenes like in the book. The two leads are great. Their chemistry's believable and they really play well off each other. It has a bit of strong language but to be fair, the book it was based off was a product of its time. Even if you never read or don't like the book, I'd say check it out. You'll have fun one way or another.$
This movie had some humor in it!! After I saw it i went out to buy it!! The movie had a really good story to it! Although showing the graveyard scene is a little much but the rest is very good!! Becky wasn't a very good Becky. In my opinion Tom Sawyer could have done a lot better!! The movie for me kinda goes to fast but i liked it very much!! It is a great family film but for Jonathan Taylor Thomas it is no Home Improvements but it is the closest thing to it! Besides it is set up in the 1800s and Tom Sawyer and Randy Taylor dress totally different! If you are a J.T.T you will like this and if your not it is still a good movie!!$

Sudden Death (1995)$
Since one of my favorite action star of this generation, Michael Jai White want to make an unofficial sequel to a 90s Die Hard scenario movie called Sudden Death staring the great Jean Claude Van Damme so naturally as a fan of Van Damme and all the Die Hard clone movies no matter how bad or low budget they are I'm quite excited to finally watch this movie for the first time ever and although its not quite awesome like I anticipated it still quite a treat tbh. Because there nothing original in this movie except the hockey stadium setting so all of my attention is on how good Van Damme carry this movie and needless to say, he does that pretty well with many unique ways to kill the bad guys especially the hilarious and definitely in my top 10 favorite Van Damme action sequences where he battles a villain in a mascot costume.$
Sudden Death just might be Jean-Claude Van Damme's best movie to date along with Hard Target,Bloodsport,Lionheart,and Cyborg!Powers Boothe is great and there is always action,great fights and interesting moments in the film!The film is very satisfying and entertaining and recommend for big time action fans!$
Sudden Death was a good action film. The plot was simple and easy to understand..It didnt try to become something it isnt and end up confusing you. Jean-Claude Van Damme gave a strong performance and so did Powers Boothe. He was extremely convincing as "the bad guy". The movie at times is a little far fetched..but most movies are.  I also thought it was very cool how Jean-Claude's character used lots of odd objects to create weapons(Fire extinguisher, tube and darts)..anyway if your looking for a good action movie to watch, Sudden Death should be your choice.$
Sudden Death is a well made movie,it has great action sequences,pretty good acting and a very high level of entertainment.The movie starts out really well,and ends really well.Van Damme gives a great action performance,and his co-stars do as well.Great action sequences,and a high level of entertainment makes Sudden Death a must see.$
Jean-Claude Van Damme, my country's most profitable export product (right behind beer, chocolate and waffles), stars in what is arguably one of the top three best films of his career. I deliberately state top three, because personally I'm also a big fan of "Death Warrant" and "Hard Target" even though I might be the only one. "Sudden Death" is a typical "Die Hard" clone, like there were far too many of them throughout the nineties, but it's one of the chosen few that are actually great fun and closely approaching the quality level of the actual "Die Hard" sequels (not the one and only original, of course). This accomplishment is largely thanks to the craftsmanship of director Peter Hyams and – also typical for major action blockbusters – the presence of a genuinely evil villain you just hate to love. In this particular case it's Powers Booth who depicts his terrorist/robber character continuously straight-faced and seemingly emotionless regardless of who he kills or what challenge overcomes him. Booth and his equally evil platoon of accomplices invade the Vice Presidents' lounge during the prestigious Stanley Cup ice-hockey finale and demand for a whole lot of money to be transferred to secret bank accounts all across the globe. If there aren't sufficient transfers at the end of each game period, Booth kills off one of the hostages. In case the whole sum isn't transferred at the end of the game, he threatens to blow up the entire stadium with everyone in it. Luckily for the thousands of (unaware) spectators, the tough former fireman JCVD is the arena's responsible fire safety inspector and Power Booth made the terrible mistake of taking his young daughter hostage. "Sudden Death" guarantees adrenalin-rushes from start to finish, with violent shootouts as well as brutal hand combat battles, a suspenseful race-against-the-clock aspect, a bit of disaster-movie mayhem near the finale and a handful of cool (if predictable) plot twists. I wouldn't know what to possibly expect more from a 90's action movie.$
OK, let's be straight forward. This is not Oscar material. It's a typical hostage movie similar to the Die Hard series. There are some pretty decent action sequences and some that just don't plain make any sense and, after you see them, you will be left kinda confused. Having said that, this is a good movie. The best part about this movie is, surprisingly, the bad guy. Powers Boothe plays the lead terrorist and he plays it well. At times you root for him because he plays the part so well. Unfortunately, it's hard to root against this guy because of his wise-ass attitude, but some of his quotes are memorable and quite amusing. (Example: To the vice president "I voted for you. I really did. It's your sincerity and compassion. However there may be a need to kill someone else. Now we're gonna make this work or we're gonna die trying!") This is a typical Van Damme film except in this one he plays a little hockey. This movie, albeit a bit done-before, is surrounded by an entertaining cast that propels this from a 5 to a 7.$
Reuniting Hyams and Van Damme, director and star of Timecop, this spectacular nail-biter exploits their combined, if limited, abilities to the full.Steven Seagal had Under Siege, Wesley Snipes had Passenger 57 and Kurt Russell had Executive Decision, then it was Van Damme's second collaboration with director Peter Hyams that resulted in arguably his most accessible and mainstream movie to date. It's a classic 'everyman versus terrorists' scenario, but executed with aplomb and filled with a great sense of scale (helped in no small part by Hyams' skill as a director of photography) and memorable moments.Van Damme is at his butt-kicking best, with Sudden Death offering all the thrills, spills and stuff blowing up that action fans relish. Offers above-average pyrotechnics, a body count that steadily mounts, and plenty of hand-to-hand combat. The best of the many Die Hard rip-offs made during the 1990s. Sudden Death is a thrilling roller-coaster ride of hard-edged action. Fun Die Hard knockoff that uses the stadium for all its worth. The mascot fight is a highlight.A mildly satisfying high-energy romp complete with outstanding professional hockey footage and intense physical confrontations.$
This movie has probably one of the most pathetic stories i´ve seen in a very long time. I mean, the sudden death and all of that... It´s just plain silly. And it makes me feel like they didn´t know what to do about the original story and added stuff afterwards to fill out the 1hour and thirty minutes. But still. This movie is all i´ve come to expect from a Van Damme movie. Good fight scenes, good stunts and lousy acting. And there are some scenes in this movie that almost saves it. Like the fight with the mascot which is a must-see. So, to make a long story shorter this is a movie that you can see when you just want some plain and simple fun without demands for good actors or a good story.$

GoldenEye (1995)$
One of my favourite quotes from this film you know. As for GoldenEye, I consider it the best of the Pierce Brosnan Bond films. Pierce Brosnan makes for a great and likable title character, and Judi Dench is rock-solid as always as M. Izabella Scorupco is a splendid Natalya and I loved feisty Xenia, marvellously played by Famke Janssen, who kills her victims by crushing them between her thighs, while Janus is wonderfully mysterious as a villain. Technically, GoldenEye can't be faulted either. The cinematography is beautiful, while the locations are superb and the stunts perfectly done especially the car chase through the streets of St Petersburg. The music and theme song are very memorable too, the pacing is brisk and the script and plot are well intact. GoldenEye mayn't be the best Bond film ever, but it is for me one of the more enjoyable ones. 9/10 Bethany Cox$
This film is the best of the classic James Bond films, i.e. those before the Daniel Craig reboot. It hits the right tone where it is not too serious but also not too silly either. The pacing is exciting and Pierce Brosnan is classy as always.$
This is by far one of the best Bond films simply because it does not try to be a Bond film.  GoldenEye demonstrates an impressive independence that separates it from the tried-and-true-but-getting-boring Bond formula.  The one liners are not that great, but the action sequences are mindblowing. The chase scene is the best I have ever seen in any movie.  Period.  Purists will complain that there is a lack of gadgetry, but let them pout and go back to MacGyver reruns.  Possibility is not permissibility.  Just because Bond has a snazzy car does not mean that he has to utilize every perk that Q has included.  It is a relief that the writers did not force a new scene just to show off the car.  The movie does not need one, which helps it to maintain its quality as not just a Bond movie, but a high quality action movie that can stand on its own.  You will even find (gasp!) . . . character building!  There is actually dialogue between Q and Bond, instead of just a briefing and some commands.  Brosnan more than holds his own against past Bonds, and offers some of that GQ gentlemen element found missing in some of the past ones.  Bond fan, action fan, any fan, check this one out.  I even made my girlfriend watch it, and even she enjoyed it.  Chances are you will too.$
After a 6 year hiatus the producers needed to make this film good enough to bring Bond back to the forefront, and in comparison to the films that followed, I believe this to be the best. Without a cold war to fuel plot lines, the story is able to step into new territories, with many great plot elements. Pierce Brosnan portrays Bond amazingly well in my opinion, and ties all the classic 007 elements together flawlessly. Although adhering to the Bond foundations, this film has a great, fresh feel to it, I think partly due to the industrial style score by Eric Serra. I think you need to see this film more than once to fully appreciate it, but it is definitely a classic!$
Pierce Brosnan's first outing as the iconic spy was a good one. Goldeneye hit the mark with a great story, a progressive M, Bond girl and soundtrack. Pierce makes the role his own and nicely takes on the mantle of 007. Viewers can embrace a new and modern Bond for the 90s. Goldeneye is a special film for me as it was the first 007 film I watched with my parents and it hit the bullseye for me. I was captivated by this great story from start to finish. Decent film and Pierce's best Bond film.$
Pierce Brosnan is outstanding as 007 in GOLDENEYE, but the film lacks the spirit of Timothy Dalton's two cracking adventures, THE LIVING DAYLIGHTS and LICENCE TO KILL. This film, alone, earned twice as much as those two and in a way it's sad because it shows that people are coming to watch Bond films that now concentrate on action, modern technology etc, than those which have these elements but still have a lot more in them. Timothy Dalton should return.$
I've probably watched GoldenEye more than any other Bond film. I really enjoy this movie. It manages to reboot the franchise in a way that acknowledges past weaknesses while still maintaining the spirit of James Bond. There are plenty of flaws I could point out, but the ride is enjoyable enough that I'm willing to forgive most of them. And Pierce Brosnan works so well as 007. It's just a shame his other entries weren't as good as this one.$

"American President$
The writing is sharp, though you can tell Sorkin hadn't quite mastered his style. The story is actually pretty reasonable and makes for an interesting film. Michael Douglas is excellent as the president and you can see the model from which Sorkin would craft Josiah Bartlet. All in all, this is a decent diversion and I enjoyed most of it.$
One of the greatest movie finale speeches ever, literal chills. The american president has always been a favorite of mine. The characters are well acted and quite lovely. The storyline is unique and has a good mix of heartfelt and comical. Endlessly rewatchable.$
"The American President" was the source of the later dramatic television series success "The West Wing". Apparently, statist influencers in the U.S. have become so successful at warping the real by "spin" that many people could not understand this seminal film, especially those incompetent reviewers who masquerade as professional critics. It is by any standard of reason I suggest 1. authentic in its meticulously presented milieu, characters and dialogue, 2. an appealing classically romantic comedy and 3. a wonderfully satiric juxtaposition between the American--the self-responsible--qualities of even a president and his vulnerability to pseudo-religious moralizing attacks as he tries to access his individual rights in a nation gone constitutionally insane under the urging of Postmodernists. All this widower president wants at the beginning is a date with a feisty environmental lobbyist; later he wants her as a girl friend, and vice versa, with a a chance to explore their growing relationship. This simple human dignity is compromised as a right by the opposition party's leading candidate, who uses innuendo and false headlining to undermine the man's public popularity and threaten two vital bills both the president and the lobbyist are trying to get through a stone-walling Congress. Rob Reiner directs in a serious and lyrical way dialogue and character revelations that in lesser hands might have been slow or worse; in my judgment the pace never falters for an instant. Aaron Sorkin 's memorable script takes in issues, personalities, levels of relationship and supervision that I believe were both difficult and rewarding with uncommon precision and skill. As the "American"--individual, realist, pro- rights--president, Michael Douglas achieves award level simplicity and command at the same time, something which he had been growing toward for two decades. Only players with shorter roles--John Mahoney, and White House staffers--are really exactly right in their roles; but the clarity of the characters presented in the film's script is so strong, owing the the power of the central character and his categorical value of individualism, that sincere performances become exceptional. Annette Benning is attractive and passable as the lobbyist--first girl friend; Martin Sheen is acceptable as Douglas's aide; but no one is outstandingly good I claim nor unacceptable; their believability I suggest is produced by the ideas and values they are representing. Michael J. Fox's speech level is inadequate as the committed, immature aide; Samantha Mathis and Shawna Waldron and Leon Kodak, Anna Deavere Smith, Richard Dreyfuss, Gail Strickland, and many others get small telling moments; the film centers so well I claim on the president and his lady that all else become background, mosaic pieces in a larger picture, observing, relating to, or commenting on the main thrust of action--a president doing his job and asking his rights. This centrality leading to unforgettable scenes is a quality only the best films possess--"The Guns of Navarone", "The Fountainhead", "Gone With the Wind" and "Bend of the River", for instance. In a comedy, this is a rare achievement therefore. Marc Shaiman's music is unobtrusive and occasionally moving; Gloria Gresham's costumes and the production design by Lilly Kilvert aid the film's hard-won credibility. Cinematography by John Seale and Art Direction by John Warnke are outstandingly believable. I suggest the producers Charles Newirth, Rob Reiner, Barbara Maltby and Jeffrey Stott have achieved something as rare here as was achieved in "An Affait to Remember", "The Bridal Path", "You Came Along" and "Operation Petticoat" and other service-based idea-level satires--something lasting, emotionally satisfying and unusually profound for any genre.$
This film worked for the same reason the West Wing works... it humanizes the President.  Yes, the most powerful man in the world has feelings and falls in love.  I liked one reviewer's comment saying that this film is Capra-esque.  It certainly is because of its overall feel-good aspect and optimism.  I enjoyed this film, and Michael Douglas seldom disappoints me. 8/10.$
This film sees the best acting from Michael Douglas (my God, he isn't a villain), Annette Bening (power woman), Michael J Fox (finally not a teen) and Martin Sheen (oh so amusing).  This is such a warm film.  It is innocent yet powerful. And the humour is second to none.  Just fabulous.$
9/10 - smart, entertaining, and often funny, this is this best movie about the Commander-in-Chief$
.....than this, despite the three f-bombs that are dropped in the last half hour of the film. And the emotional situation that was taking place, makes it understandable. THIS is what we need for a President. Especially when Louis, an AWESOME performance by Michael J Fox, tells the president off. Why? Because, as a citizen, this is HIS President! The president in this country works for us. And guess what the problems are? Crime and the environment. And this movie was made in 1995!!! almost 30 years ago. Annette Bening is Sydney, the President's girlfriend, who is a powerful lobbyist. She is very passionate about her job. But then their jobs clash. In the end the President's last words to Sydney are, "Well, it turns out, I've got a rose garden." Michael Douglas, if only we were all still 30 younger. Anyway, you get the picture, he does the right thing in the end. If you haven't seen this film, see it. Oh and a shout out to Martin Sheen, as the Cheif of staff. Please! See it. It's sort of a Cinderella story, and yes, it's fiction. But still......dot dot dot!!!!😔😔😔$
This movie has been blessed with a great script, an outstanding ensemble of actors and wonderful direction by Rob Reiner. My favorite performance is by Martin Sheen but all of the actors do a great job. I have the DVD of this movie and I watch it at least once a month. I think movies like this [Dave, for example, and Air Force One, to an extreme degree]are so enjoyable to me, and others, because they portray the kind of president we would like to see in the White House. A very idealistic point of view, perhaps, but you have to take your "heroes" where you can find them.$

Dracula: Dead and Loving It (1995)$
While this skewering of the Dracula mythology and the various cinematic interpretations of the story never achieves the kind of crazy heights of "Blazing Saddles" or "Young Frankenstein", it still shows that Brooks still had it in him to come up with some great, gut busting scenes. Being a genuine horror fan as well as a comedy legend, he and his team of collaborators do go to great lengths to give this film the proper look, and it's a colourful, stylish looking movie, going with the idea that the composer wasn't in on the joke and featuring a score by Hummie Mann that's full of foreboding. Leslie Nielsen is the pratfalling prince of darkness who is set up quite well early on when he comments on the "Children of the Night" and "the mess they make" - and then promptly slips in such a mess. He's a delight as always, with wonderful support by a bunch of actors who mug for all they're worth, especially Peter MacNicol as the loony, bug munching Renfield and veteran Brooks colleague Harvey Korman, who in his performance as Dr. Seward, does an amusing impression of the actor Nigel Bruce. Brooks himself, in fine hammy form, plays the part of the intrepid Van Helsing. Lysette Anthony and Amy Yasbeck are both quite ravishing as Lucy and Mina respectively, with Steven Weber as a prudish and uptight Jonathan Harker, and Mark Blankfield, Megan Cavanagh, and Clive Revill doing well in smaller roles. Cameos include Avery Schreiber, Chuck McCann, co-screenwriter Rudy De Luca, Charlie Callas, and the wonderful Anne Bancroft paying tribute to Maria Ouspenskaya in her brief bit. Standout scenes include the staking of Lucy (Van Helsing stays well out of the way for good reason), the breakfast sequence with MacNicol and Korman, which is particularly priceless, and the scene where Dracula is trying to manipulate both Mina and Essie and not having much success. A snappily paced movie leading to a fairly big finish, "Dracula: Dead and Loving It" is good entertainment as Brooks comedies go, and even gives its principal cast members the kind of "curtain call" at the end that we don't see in movies that often. Seven out of 10.$
This comedy followed the Bram Stoker book very closely. It merely turned the whole tale into a hilarious romp, making fun of Dracula and his inept sidekick, Renfield, as well as the other characters. A lot of slapstick gags in this film, some I saw coming from a mile off, but I still got a kick out of them. I especially liked the scene where Van Helsing and Harker staked the vampire in the tomb - what a riot. Neilson was great as the troubled bloodsucker.$
The film is not vintage Mel Brooks and it has some obvious flaws, but it is nonetheless a true joy to watch and is sure to make you smile.  My main problem was that it did not meet my initial expectations.  Young Frankenstein is CLASSIC Mel Brooks.  It is a flawless film parody of the Frankenstein myth.  I went into seeing Dracula:  Dead and Loving It with extremely high expectations and was a bit disappointed.  The film, however, is a good film and a good parody of the Bram Stoker classic  It is not as good as Love at First Bite, but has many excellent moments.  Some of the highlights are Leslie Nielson, with whom the torch of modern comedy rests safely for being absurd yet sublime in his characterization, his superb imitation of Bela Lugosi's mannerisms and speech enhance his comedy. The film also is surprisingly faithful; to the novel and has many inside jokes.  Harvey Korman, Peter MacNicol, and Mel Brooks all lend a hand in the lunacy.  The setting is surreal and gives the picture a Hammeresgue quality. A must see for horror fans who  like a good belly laugh!$
It's impossible for Mel Brooks to make a completely bad film (well, then again, there was "Life Stinks".......) and "Dracula - Dead and Loving It", while hardly up there with "Young Frankenstein", has enough good yuks in it to make it well worth watching. Leslie Nielsen, whose work in the "Naked Gun" series I am not fond of, is actually excellent here in his portrayal of the Count, i.e., in his Lugosi impersonation. Anne Bancroft (Mrs. Mel Brooks) makes the most of her little cameo as the gypsy woman. Worth a see.$
I still don't understand how this movie isn't regarded as a comedy classic. While still displaying appropriate atmosphere and thematic technique, this film just simmers with good, old-style Mel Brooks comedy, and is hilarious throughout. For starters, the script is well written, and contains a nice mix of simple gags and more subtle comedy. Similarly, while the movie is clearly satire, it displays more than enough original material to warrant genuine praise. As is often the case, however, all these facts pale in comparison to one simple truth: the performers MAKE this film. Leslie Neilsen and Mel Brooks shine as two of the major characters, while smaller gems are found in the performances of Steven Webber and Peter MacNicol; truly, MacNicol's performance is unbelievable, and is a testament to his range as an actor. Bottom line, this is simply a lovely film, and deserves much more respect than it has been given, both commercially and critically. If you haven't, do yourself a favor, and watch this movie, although you might want to watch a handful of the classic Dracula films first, just for comedic context. Enjoy!!$
Dracula: Dead and Loving It (1995): Dir: Mel Brooks / Cast: Leslie Nielsen, Peter MacNicol, Mel Brooks, Amy Yasbeck, Steven Weber: Horror satire about wallowing in the muck of circumstances unchangeable, but it is about time that Leslie Nielsen took on the fangs of the grand face of vampires. Leslie Nielsen seems to be reworking what he perfected in the Naked Gun films but he seems comfortable portraying Dracula at his most zany. He turns Peter MacNicol into an insect eating slave and ventures out for the blood of women. Brooks is brought in as a vampire hunter. Amy Yasbeck plays the victim of neck bites and a dance with Dracula where through mirrors it appears that she hurls aimlessly without the law of gravity. This is no where near as successful or as funny as Young Frankenstein but Brooks uses this as a followup just as Robin Hood: Men in Tights is a lesser return to the success of Blazing Saddles. Nielsen goes through the motions but he is funny as Dracula, particularly his batty defeat. Brooks as the vampire hunter is the only decent supporting role and he counters formula with a superb solution involving mirrors. MacNicol and Yasbeck are total cardboard even after transformation. Steven Weber is plainly not funny and his casting is distracting, and not in a positive way. It is a satire of vampire movies that huge Brooks fans will likely be loving it. Score: 7 / 10$
"Dracula: Dead and Loving It" is a masterful spoof, though the intricacies would never be recognized by someone unfamiliar with Bram Stoker's novel. The attention to detail, and Brooksian destruction of it is superb.$

Balto (1995)$
This is a great children's movie. But, being a kid's movie doesn't mean that it isn't good for others. This film entertains audiences of all ages. I first saw this movie when I was seven. And to this day, I still love it. Kevin Bacon supplies the voice of Balto, a half-bred wolf who risks his life to travel in the cold of Alaska to retrieve a sled of dogs that were lost while bringing antibiodics back to the town of Nome to stop an epidemic. BALTO is a film to see on a cold, Sunday when you have nothing better to do. You will enjoy this film greatly. After viewing it once, you will want to see it again. I lost track of how many times I have seen this film. But it has been more than thirty times. See this movie. It's well worth seeing. This one is one that I am proud to have in my video collection.....5/5.$
This film has a seriousness and drama to it that will surprise you. There are no songs, and it has an adult feel to it, with mature themes and exciting action. The voice characters are its main failing, with Kevin Bacon giving rather flat performance to Balto, and there is an overall lack of conviction in most of the other voices as well.  But this movie has good story and excellent pacing- there are several gripping action sequences, and very few childish moments. Balto is an excellent family film, and will keep adults and older kids enthralled and entertained.  I think it's a little too serious for very young kids to enjoy, though.  It has realism and is not light hearted. There are ideas about sickness, death and prejudice which are used very well to move this story along and help resolve it in the end. This is a hero story with a feel-good ending, and plenty of adventure along the way.  The art and appearance is interesting and unique, mostly classic animation with a few computer assisted scenes-- the overall look is tidy and quality, with some charm and humor that will get you smiling.  It has a live action entry and closure (including a view of the Balto statue in Central Park) which acts as a tie-together, and the true story behind this movie gives it additional appeal. This film, like the WB's 'Iron Giant', has been breezed over by the public and not gotten the recognition it deserves. I would recommend Balto for anyone who likes dogs, realism, or just a smooth, enjoyable film.$
It's not hard to see why this movie wasn't particularly popular (check out the scene where the carpenter is shown sadly preparing small coffins), but that doesn't mean it isn't worth a look.  It's actually one of the best underrated animated films of the 90's.  The drama is real, the visuals are beautiful, and the story ends happily.  The live action prologue and epilogue are a little distracting, but they're made up for by a random (and hilarious) visual shout-out to "E.T."$
Where can I start? This movie is greatly animated, directed and written. There's no cheesy songs to slow it up or a boring storyline. Every angle that is shown is perfect, every background and colour scheme is great. The music by James Horner is well done and fits the moods of the film. Whether you're a kid or an adult, you will find yourself cheering Balto on.$
Balto &amp; his friends, Boris, Muk, Luk &amp; Jenna are characters to capture the heart. Romance, humour &amp; determination lead us on an epic adventure through the snow. The voicing is excellent and the soundtrack is too. Steele is a good villain. There are some impressive animated sequences especially with the wolves &amp; the bear. An overlooked masterpiece. 10/10$
Toy Story may have stolen the spotlight from Balto in 1995, but this is an under-the-radar movie anyway. They barely stretched the story to over an hour with all the filler they threw in. But it's a harmless movie with a heartwarming message. Good boy, Balto.$
I used to love this animation until I watched Togo. Please do so so you can learn about the True Hero of the 1925 serum run to Nome! Stories like these should be told properly especially if this can educate kids.$
People have always seemed to have a soft spot for heroic fictional dogs. Whether it's on television like 'Lassie' (1954-1973), 'Rin Tin Tin' (1954-1959), &amp; or heart-warming family films like 'Old Yellow' (1957) &amp; 'Benji' (1974) series. These creatures has captures our love and affection as few other things. So it's only natural, to want to hear about real-life dogs who save people for real, like Balto (1919-1933), whom help out on a supple run, to prevent a deadly epidemic from ravaging Nome, Alaska in 1925. However, I can't say, this animation film from Amblin Entertainment &amp; Universal Pictures is historic accurate. There were a few parts in this film directed by Simon Wells that was a little far-fetched like the idea that one set of dog-sled mushers made the seven hundred miles from Nenana to Nome to stop an epidemic, in a few days, when it normally takes 25 days. In truth, 1925 Serum Run, also known as "Great Race of Mercy", carry out the task in five and half days, without much breaks, because they had 20 mushers and about 150 sled dogs, at relay points throughout the path. If anything, it was more a relay race than a marathon. Also, Balto in real life, wasn't the dog that went through the longest and most hazardous part of the run. That honor goes to Togo, who led his team on a 91-mile journey that included crossing the perilous ice of Norton Sound. The real Balto, only got the credit, because they were the ones that arrived in Nome. This claim to fame, became a source of controversy by many historians, as many consider Togo to be the true hero &amp; should had been immortalized with a statue in Central Park. Also, I hate the fact that the movie makes it look like the human mushers were mostly unconscious, incapacitated or inadequate, the whole time, as if it was the dogs that was leading the way. In truth, people like Gunnar Kaasen, Leonhard Seppala, Bill Shannon, Edgar Kalland, Jack Nicolai, Myles Gonangnan, Henry Ivanoff, and others, deserve credit as well. They made life threatens, decisions in the way, they travel, often changing paths. Some of them, lost dogs, and nearly lose their hands to frostbite, because of the dangerous journey. Another thing, I have to criticize about the film is it's out of place &amp; over the top, predictable villain in Steele (Voiced by Jim Cummings) who Balto (Voiced by Kevin Bacon) have to fight with. I felt the movie didn't one. After all, man vs nature is already a very good conflict. His presence was really, jarring. I don't get, how he was able to get ahead of the race team and ruin the markings of the tree, after being lost, with them, only a few minutes, earlier. It just doesn't add up. Why, don't they just use, their nose in the first place!? Not all changes that the screenwriters, Cliff Ruby, Elana Lesser, David Steven Cohen &amp; Roger S. H. Schulman were bad. I kinda like the idea of the film portray Balto as a gray outcast street wolf-dog, rather than a pure bred Siberian husky. It adds to the idea of being isolated, because people fear him as a dangerous wild animal. I love that he is looking for a chance to fit in and proving to his peers that he is capable for compassion. I also didn't mind, all the obstacles that he had to go through on his journey; even if some of them, don't make sense, like the bear sequence. Aren't they, supposed to be hibernation? Anyways, all the action scenes were all intense and help make the film, a little more compelling than what it original could had been. I also didn't mind, the illogical, weird editing of live action modern-day narrative with the animation flashbacks sequences; as it adds to the tone, of a parent reading their children, a kid friendly's fairy tale version of real-events. Even the dialogue scenes with the dogs talking, while the humans not understanding the animals, wasn't much of a problem for me; as the dogs don't really say much. Plus, I saw this, play out, in many traditional dog related Disney animation films before, such as 1955's 'Lady &amp; the Tramp' &amp; 1961's '101 Dalmatians'. In truth, the voice acting for the dogs weren't that bad. The voice acting for the other animals were little more questionable, like Bob Hoskins as Boris, the goose and singer Phil Collins, as sidekicks Polar Bears, Muk &amp; Luk. They could be a bit annoying, at times. Still, for the most part, they were there for some good laughs, which, they delivered on. I also dig, the music from composer, James Horner. Overall: I wish more people went to go see 'Balto' at the time. While not an outright bomb, it didn't turn a profit, due to new-kid-on-the-block Pixar releasing 'Toy Story'; which slaughtered this film at the box office. Some animation fans consider it to be the first sign of CGI eventually overthrowing traditional animation. It's sad, because the animation was honestly pretty good for Amblimation film. Sadly, the studio close its doors after only three films, as most of the staff would migrate over to Dreamworks Animation for 1998's 'The Prince of Egypt'. In the end, while it's not the most heart feel or entertaining, animated movie out there, Balto is still worth watching. It's engaging and very though-provoking. While, you can't teach an old dog, new tricks. You can still teach your children to grasp complex social issues, while showing them, great examples of honor, duty, self-sacrifice, humility, &amp; dedication in the face of fear, with Balto. It's a must-watch.$
Watch Togo instead. He was the real hero of Nome, Alaska.$
I am surprised that I like this at all. I first saw this when I was in fifth grade watching this film for the Iditarod unit. This film is actually based on a true event that happened in 1925. The main character is a half dog, half wolf that wants happiness and companionship, but he is neglected. Then one day, children fall sick because of severe sickness. Medicine can be reached only by dogsled. A team is sent out, but they get lost. Then, Balto comes to the rescue. This movie has some funny points and some serious points. The voice acting was good and the script worked well. The score was also pretty good. The only negative thing is why animation! It would've been better without animation. But, overall this surprising film gets a 8/10.$

Nixon (1995)$
Oliver Stone has a way of making films that grab you and hold you until the final frame.  His films are usually controversial and that's what generates much debate and Nixon is no exception.  Anthony Hopkins assumes the mantle of Richard M. Nixon and he does it with style. His Nixon is a complex man, full of ambition and dreams, but also filled with demons.  Nixon lives in the shadow of JFK, and because of that, he feels he can never live up to the greatness that he aspires to.  Joan Allen is equally convincing as Pat Nixon.  She is a strong woman who loves her husband, but unlike Nixon, she grows tired of the political world. The film works best when we see the inner workings of the Nixon Whitehouse.  We see the coverup of the Watergate break in.  We see Nixon's historic visit to China and we see the final farewell of a flawed, but ambitious man.  It's hard to cram an entire lifetime into a three hour film, but Stone manages to do it well.  We get brief glimpses into Nixon's past and we see the events that eventually undid him.  Some may say that Nixon is painted in an unfair light.  I think Stone actually sympathizes with him.  Here was a man who came into power in the middle of a war.  He was feared by many and misunderstood by all.   Nixon was able to rise above it all for a short period of time, and in that brief period, he did have the world.$
Richard Nixon's (Oscar-nominee Anthony Hopkins) life is told from his early childhood days in 1920s California to his disgraceful resignation in 1974 from the Watergate scandal (one of the stupidest and most trivial events of U.S. history). The 37th president of the U.S. lost the 1960 presidential election to JFK and then lost the California governor race of 1962. By 1963 it appears that Nixon is out of the spotlight for good politically and that he is struggling to keep his marriage to Pat Nixon (a superb turn by Oscar-nominee Joan Allen in arguably her finest role) alive. Things turn strange though as Nixon has strange meetings with big-time oil men in Texas (Larry Hagman leading the group) and even with J. Edgar Hoover (scene-stealer Bob Hoskins). It is obvious that there are some potentially sinister things going on from high-ranking people. Soon JFK is assassinated, the 1964 election becomes a mess for both parties as LBJ wins by default and then LBJ decides not to run in 1968. The Republicans once again turn to Nixon, but Nixon (full of self-doubt and inferiority complexes) is fearful that 1968 against RFK will be a repeat of 1960 (Nixon believes that JFK and the Democrats stole the 1960 presidency). More cloak and dagger situations occur and RFK is assassinated in California, leaving the door open for Nixon to win the presidency. Vietnam, a whole host of questionable allies (led by James Woods, E.G. Marshall, J.T. Walsh, David Paymer, David Hyde Pierce, Powers Boothe, Fyvush Finkel) and constant advisement from Henry Kissinger (an amazing transformation by Paul Sorvino, who rivals Hopkins' performance the whole way) end up turning Nixon's life upside down. Soon taped White House conversations and growing paranoia also pops up and public/national/international/military/social chaos ensues. While all this occurs the president's personal life is shown through flashbacks (Mary Steenburgen as his mother and Tony Goldwyn as his older brother dominate these parts of the film). We see two of his brothers dying of tuberculosis, his short courtship of his wife and various other parts of his early life that stand out. The Watergate break-in (led by Ed Harris) continues to be one of the strangest things that has ever happened (the motives of the apparent burglary have never been clear). 18 minutes of missing audio recordings are one of the biggest mysteries of the 20th Century. Director Oliver Stone (who received an Oscar nod for co-writing the script) surprisingly is unbiased with this film. Watching "Platoon", "Born on the Fourth of July" and "JFK" would lead one to believe that Stone would pull no punches with "Nixon". However he gives Nixon's story an element of truth and compassion. There are so many unknown things that went on with Nixon throughout his political career that Stone has to fill in lots of missing pieces with speculations (some that seem very logical and some not so much). Thus the film goes on and on (running about 195 minutes). Even with all the airtime though the film does not move slowly and never becomes dull. In fact it is one of those projects that could have gone on even longer and it still would have been an interest-generator. Whether you like, dislike or are indifferent when it comes to Nixon the person, "Nixon" the movie is an outstanding achievement that stands high with Stone's better works and also deceptively becomes one of the more under-rated and under-appreciated pictures of the 1990s. 5 stars out of 5.$
Oliver Stone enables the movie audience to attain a full dynamic on the Nixon Presidency with this movie!! In a time of transition with American values, Richard Nixon had to succumb to a Keynesian resolution to the United States' economic woes!! Relentlessy burdening inflation reduced the nation to a quasi socialist measure of wage and price control!! Oil dependency on the Arabs was formidably alarming!! To top it all off, the ubiquitous monster of continued involvement in the Vietnam War was constantly rearing it's ugly head!! Such an atrocity brought on a bevy of anti-war protesters in front of the White House lawn on an ephemeral basis!! Now descends the left wing liberal ideological philosophy of desegregation through busing!! Political plea bargaining coerced Richard Nixon to renege on his pledges to corporate giants who put him in the White House in 1968!! Nixon's insolence and self righteousness incensed everybody!! His mainstream appeal was due to extremes on both sides of the political spectrum, two such examples are; George Wallace (Right) and George McGovern (Left). The cacophony of foul language and racial hatred by the Nixon White House was deplorable!! Why? Nixon was the commander in chief of the United States!! An insidious aspect to this hatred was very nauseating because it signified how many Americans who were likened to the mindset of Nixon cabinet, actually thought!! These dubious conceptions of the Nixon cabinet were perplexing the American people as to what actual ideologies were implementing a resolution on the final decisions made pertaining to copious political issues!! The egalitarian pretenses that these politicians so often masqueraded, were merely a facade!! This film's full persecutive of Richard Nixon's political life was a laboriously successful rendition of Nixon's volatile temperament, this haunting character portrayal was flawlessly executed by world renowned director, Oliver Stone!! In so many of his movies, Oliver Stone is uncanny in his ability to itemize a comprehensive hatred with the characters in his film.. When making this movie about Richard Nixon, the former president of the United States, he (Oliver Stone) depicts the intensity of how abhorrent Nixon's philosophical proclivities actually were!! Oliver Stone accurately pinpoints the composite personality of Nixon as a social anathema who was a victim of his fundamentalist environment!! In giving my assessment of President Nixon, allow me to say this: I am a Republican, I have empathized with Richard Nixon concerning his candor with regard to human imperfection, at the same time, this does not mean that he should have cultivated a Carte Blanche to repetitively engage in egregious human character discrepancies!! Nixon did not contest the 1960 Presidential race against John F. Kennedy, even though, many of his advisers encouraged him to do so!! Such a protestation was on account of the contention that some states had allegedly fixed the election by stuffing their ballot boxes!! Nixon felt it was in the best interest of his political career not to pursue this matter!! In so doing this, he resented JFK and the rest of the prominent Kennedys all of his life... I would not be too fond of someone who massacred me in a string of nationally televised debates either!! Nixon's words for John F Kennedy were: "The American people looked at JFK and saw what they wanted to be, they look at me and see what they are!!" Nixon's biggest problem was that he made an enemy out of everyone!! This was a president who was all too anxious to lay blame to the fact that he was grotesquely misunderstood as being the culprit to his disheveled presidency!! While he ended the Vietnam War, this is like saying that after you stabbed someone's hand, you stopped the bleeding!! This film points out how Nixon isolated all political coalitions with whom he had to corroborate, that was his undoing!! This precarious situation brought on his ultimate political nemesis.. Watergate... The Washington Post's unearthing of the Watergate break-in brought on a revolutionary breach of public trust in the system of American democracy, hence, all of the media affiliates converged accordingly!! Nixon's post as an appointed public official was viewed by him with a sanctimonious temerity, thus, he invoked executive clemency as an indelible prerogative to quell investigation into the Watergate affair. What was infuriating to the American people was that the executive branch of the United States government could be complicit in the crime involving a third rate burglary!! Talks of espionage, sabotage, and wiretapping evoked a very distasteful resolve with the American public!! Henry Kissinger, H R Halderman, and President Nixon, were the triumvirate in the Oval office who mandated the use of the fifth amendment!! Such theatrics were construed by the American people as actions which were tantamount to an admission of culpability by the Nixon Administration!! Nixon's presumed innocence was contingent on his option for executive privilege!! This privilege was revoked by the supreme court on account of the fact that the Nixon administration was up against criminal charges!! The movie "Nixon" portrayed Watergate with an ultimate clarity, yes, it was nurtured with a liberal bias, at the same time, this was the Rolls Royce of Republican blundering, therefore, it was time for the opposing party to capitalize on the entire matter!! The acting in this movie was sensational!! James Woods was terrific as H R Halderman, Joan Allen portrayed Pat Nixon with a very succinct realism... Paul Sorvino's role as Henry Kissinger was simply fantastic!! and of course, Anthony Hopkins proves his acting genius once again, with the part of Richard Nixon, as he is one of the best actors in the history of all movie making... The camera angles and the severity of agitated emotions is spellbinding with this movie!! See this Film, it is a definite winner!!$
After sitting through this painfully long and very drawn-out film, I can't help but feel that it is just slightly... redundant. I watched this with my father, who actually followed Nixon's career to some extent, and I can't deny that without his giving me cliff notes to explain actions and motivation of the characters every so often during the film, I wouldn't understand any of what happened. And that's the sad truth... if you don't know almost everything about Nixon, his time, the political situation, what happened during that period of time, etc. you won't understand it. The film hints at so many things, instead of making what happens clear, and presumes you know everything behind every situation, instead of providing any back-story. We get scene after scene, one situation after another with people we're supposed to know beforehand, situations we're expected to know of and understand and if you don't know of these, and you have no way of knowing them, you certainly won't know after watching the film. The film really isn't the story of Richard M. Nixon as much as it's Oliver Stone's objective presentation of him. How are we supposed to judge this man, his staff, or any of their actions when we don't know the situation or the background of it? Then there are of course those who do know these things... but why would they watch it? They already know the things presented in the movie, and probably from a far more reliable source. So, I guess what it comes down to is: who is this film actually aimed at? Who can watch this and really enjoy it? My father suggested that Stone's intention with this film was to tell the story to young Americans, teenagers who weren't even alive when what the film is about happened. A good cause, but again, it requires them to already know of Nixon. And that is ultimately this movies downfall. The plot is very good, and from what I understand, quite accurate. The pacing is... off, I think is the right word. It switches between going insanely fast and painfully slow, making the film a sure-fire head-ache machine. The acting is perfectly flawless, and most, if not all of the characters based on real people are historically accurate in personality and appearance. The time-line is somewhat messed up, but the basic idea is that Nixon is actually sitting and thinking back on all this stuff, so it makes perfect sense and is used nicely(as opposed to as a cheap gimmick). The film is good, definitely, it's just so limited in who it will appeal to, and the pacing is a real killer(and I don't mean that in the good way). I recommend this to anyone who is interested in Nixon and big fans of Oliver Stone. I suppose very big fans of members of the cast might want to give it a chance as well. 7/10$
Without doubt Anthony Hopkins performance as Richard Nixon cements his position as one of the finest and most powerful actors of the last 20 years. Without bearing any great resemblance, he gets closer to inhabiting the almost impenetrable enigma that was Nixon than any other actor could do. Looking beyond his towering portrayal, the performances of the supporting cast are mostly exemplary. You just know that James Woods and JT Walsh were born to play Haldeman and Ehrlichman. Ed Harris is a chilling Howard Hunt, Mary Steenburgen a dedicated but controlled and ultimately unaffectionate mother, Powers Boothe a loyal but pragmatic Al Haig, Bob Hoskins a thoroughly devious J Edgar Hoover and Madeleine Kahn a delightfully outspoken Martha Mitchell. If I had to quibble I would say that Joan Allen makes Pat Nixon a far steelier character than she probably was and EG Marshall is too old to play John Mitchell. Oliver Stone does not play too fast and loose with the real story and endeavours to explore Nixon's childhood and other events in his life to try to explain what what made him what he became. Occasionally he is more sympathetic than one might have expected. The use of black and white is overdone, although real footage is skilfully interlaced with the acting. But the ultimate triumph is Hopkins' performance.$
realistic. direct. giving not exactly the traits of a political man but one of the inspired views of power. because it is a story about power. simple. cruel, mix of fear and crumbs of selfishness. about a man reduced at himself. the roots of a fall. an image of America. a huge conspiracy for control. fragments of childhood. and Anthony Hopkins as the best choice for a role who seems be the mix of Shakespeare and Dostoievski dark heroes. and, sure, Oliver Stone. as a fascinating searcher of the truth. as author of a chronicle of America. a honest one. a chronicle like a large open window. and the waves of fresh air.$

Cutthroat Island (1995)$
Cutthroat Island is a movie that you can just sit back, relax and watch it with a big goofy grin on your face.  Sure it tanked at the box office, but don't disregard it totally.  It's entertaining as hell.  Geena Davis is rather engaging as a female pirate and Frank Langella seemed to be enjoying himself.  Most people will say that this movie can't hold a candle to the pirate films of Errol Flynn, and they're right.  But for a rock em sock em pirate adventure with more explosions than the high seas ever saw, watch Cutthroat Island.$
I bought this on DVD not having heard of it or read any reviews so I watched it with an open mind. It is for me a good, fun to watch, action movie which entertained me - so I don't care if it wasn't (or ever will be) Oscar material - it just entertained me and that is why I watch films. The locations used in the film are first class as are the costumes. The fact that many of the stunts in the film were performed by the actors and not stunt doubles seems to add an immediacy and credibility to the film. There is what I would call "non-nasty" violence in the film (think of the A-Team) and occasional language which although again not really nasty, could deter parents from allowing the younger members of the family from sitting down and watching this as a kind of family matinée film.$
Pure joy for fans of old fashioned sea adventure and entertaining, if stereotypical, peg-legged, eye-patched pirates shouting "Arr!", this movie does not pretend to be anything else than it is - great fun based on popular legends and beliefs rather than the facts on pirate lives. And so much the better! Non-stop action, fantastic score, breathtaking sceneries and props, adequately fun script, and, yes, even good acting (to my surprise, Geena Davis actually managed to deliver a good performance!). Frank Langella is almost as good a pirate as Walter Matthau was in Roman Polanski's equally underrated pirate classic. Hearing various bad comments about the movie, I had low expectations, but was pleasantly surprised to find out that the bad reviews and comments were simply unfair. Apparently, critics these days follow one another in "their" opinions rather than actually watching the movies, and people are looking for violence and blood of "Mortal Kombat" kind rather than simply entertaining if unrealistic movies like "Cutthroat Island" (actually, the movie seems to have been researched quite nicely - it's the first time I've seen Hollywood use actual "squad" wine bottles in a pirate movie instead of modern-shaped ones!)$
I really loved this movie growing up. We would watch it all the time, especially when playing board games. I don't get why it has such a low rating or why people think it's bad. It's genuinely a really fun and entertaining movie.$
i never that this movie had flopped in the theaters,, i was reading someone's comments and i was like wow it shouldn't have,, ig guess the times back then wasn't really ready for a swashbuckling female captain,, geena davis did do a decent job,, matthew modine was alright,, probably cud have used someone a little better to compliment geena. the premise wasn't bad,, makes you wander if pirates of the Caribbean took some of this and made it their own,, o well food for thought ,, overall this isn't a bad movie,, it has it's decent moment,, but it's not a great movie either, it's like right in the middle of the road so that's why i rated it a 5.$
This Geena Davis vanity project, directed by then husband Renny Harlin, is remembered primarily—if it's remembered at all—as one of the biggest box office bombs of all time ($10 million gross on a $100 million dollar budget). Geena Davis is way out of her depth (pun!) as the Pirate Captainess Morgan Adams, but it's not the action stuff where she comes up short. Her performance here is simply dreadful. And co-star Matthew Modine is... well, he's Matthew Modine. To his credit, the normally comatose actor does manage to squeeze every last ounce of charisma out of himself. Unfortunately, an ounce is about all that he has. With its rousing (if perhaps relentless) John Debney score, a few well staged action sequences, intermittently witty script and strong villain (Played by the great Frank Langella), "Cutthroat Island" could've been an above average swashbuckler with better leads.$

Casino (1995)$
A complex, multilayered, beautifully directed film, Martin Scorsese's Casino is a masterpiece of destruction and betrayal. Few films take so many chances and succeed so wonderfully. It takes some of the basic formulas that were found in Goodfellas and applies them to another type of story - while Goodfellas' view was ground-level, telling the story of the "blue collar" gangsters of NYC, this film tells the story of the guys who controlled those guys. And it's fascinating to watch these people run Las Vegas, control the flow of money, and then fall from the heights of power due to lust, hubris, and greed. An amazing film that will hopefully get the recognition it deserves in the years to come.$
Fueled by mob bosses, two long-time friends make it big in Las Vegas. Scorsese not only rehashes the themes he explored in "Goodfellas," but is also much too long-winded about it. After the film starts with heavily narrated expository scenes, one would expect the main story to kick in, but it continues in the same vein. This must be the most heavily narrated film in history, defying the notion that film is mainly a visual medium. Adding to the busy soundtrack is a non-stop hit parade of 1970s songs. Of course there are numerous scenes showcasing Scorsese's obsession with repulsive violence. De Niro and Pesci essentially reprise their "Goodfellas" roles. Stone is alluring.$
If you haven't seen Casino yet, stop whatever it is you're doing, rush to the nearest video store, rent it, and watch it.  Along with Mean Streets Casino is probably Scorsese's most underrated and unheralded picture.  I would also venture to say that this is probably his most ambitious film. The film deals with a particular time period and a particular atmosphere and accomplishes an overwhelming achievement by creating and accurately portraying both.  The art direction is splendid, most likely the best of any film Scorsese has ever done.  The acting is superb.  I never thought Pesci would be able to top his dynamic performance in Raging Bull until I saw Casino.  Every time I watch this picture I fall in love with it all over again.  This is the most honest depiction of Las Vegas, especially of the time period it was portrayed in.  Scorsese's direction is flawless. Perhaps it is because I watch alot of Scorsese and Kubrick films, but I am becoming less satisfied with plot driven films and more enamored by films that possess the freedom that typical stories just don't seem to hold.  Sharon Stone gives the best performance of her career, and as far as the editing is concerned, well if you believe like Kubrick and Pudovkin that a film is not shot, but built who better to have on your team than long time cohort, collaborator, and editor Thelma Schoonmaker.  Ultimately, the genius of Scorsese is not just in the mastery of the medium, but in the understanding and appreciation for the necessity of great collaborators on all levels that Scorsese has consistently utilized throughout his career.  Casino exemplifies not only the best of a Scorsese film, but transcends it.  This film is truly a gem.$
Casino has to be one of the most underrated films that Martin Scorsese directed in the nineties. The acting by the leads is good and the script is excellent. Robert Deniro gave an Oscar worthy performance and Joes Pesci is chilling yet funny again. Even Sharon Stone is good in this brilliant film$
Nothing you haven't seen before, Robert De Niro performs in a similar style to several he established his career playing and Joe Pesci can only play himself no matter what the role calls for. If organised crime capers are your thing, or you're a casino denizen, it's lucky 7s all round for you, although, on this occasion, it's complemented and elevated through an outstanding performance by Sharon Stone. She steals the picture as the addicted to anything femme fatale opportunist most men would aspire to tame and, if they did get that chance, they would soon discover the trophy wife from hell - Sam did, but don't let that put you off.$
Another good gangster themed Rom com. Lots of punching people. I like that sort of stuff$
This is one if my favorite movies ever. The three hours just fly by for me. This movie also has a special place in my life because Sharon Stone reminds me of my mom in this movie. Every single person who knows my mom and has seen this movie says that about her even my dad and it weirds us out because she is nothing like that but we love it because of that. Anyway, this movie is great. Good story telling, good camera work, great acting. I prefer it to goodfellas just because its mainly Robert being the star.$
This film grows on the viewer, the first time I saw this film it reminded me of Goodfellas too much.  After, seeing the video a few times, I belong to a movie club, the movie rates as a classic.  Long movies usually become boring, however this story is easy to follow.  It is directed well, and acted well.  I read the book, and the film follows it closely, a few events changed because of time considerations and where shorting.  The film had to be long for it to reasonbly follow the book.  This is a interesting story, and the movie follows it accurately, and the viewer goes along the journey as he was there. My opinion when you feel this the movie is very good one.$

Sense and Sensibility (1995)$
It's not easy to get seniors to do anything, even watch a movie and when you mention Jane Austen, they zone out. Yet each year when we do this film in class, about 80 percent end up loving it and that includes the guys. It's wonderful to watch them respond to the characters and get into a film that is so "talky" when they have been used to high action. To hear the girls call Willoughby a jerk and applaud Brandon at the end is great, but to listen to the boys comment on the behavior of the various characters is even better. How they respond to a society so filled with strict manners and codes of behavior also makes this film worthwhile and it generates much discussion about the importance of money in life; well, even Thompson in the commentary said the film is about money, who has it and who does not. I love showing this film to my students; after the groans when I start it on the first day, it's wonderful to hear their comments on day five when we finish. As one senior male said this year, "I wouldn't have rented this or wanted to see it, but now that I have, I admit it was pretty good, so I'm glad you showed it." This is why they are classics, kiddies.$
What an excellent film! Superb performances, spellbinding dialogue, and beautiful sets and props led to an enchanting 2 hours of lost love and hope. I loved the stiffly formal, wonderfully polite, yet stifling mores these English were forced to endure. In many cases their lives were not their own to live; in many, their lives were lived under the gun of the almighty buck. They carried right on, however, with their characteristically stiff English upper lip, come what may. Great film with a knockout ending.$
This is a remarkable film that does a very good job of depicting a rigid and quite hidebound society that often made India's caste system look reasonable and moderate by comparison.  One of the more enjoyable points for me was the fact that the "sense and sensibility" of the title had a most definite 19th Century feel and yet still remains very timeless and does not attempt to force Twentieth Century mores (probably by use of a crowbar) into a script where they do not belong.  Modern day viewpoints do not belong here.  If you want a modern day version, fine.  But it would be, at best, only a glancing and quite loose adaptation of the novel, so why do an adaptation at all, then?  Not all films have to reflect present day sensibilities.  This is a very human and compelling story with a fine cast and wonderfully witty script.  Look for a very dry and understated performance by Hugh Laurie as Mr. Palmer, the long-suffering husband of the daughter of Mrs. Jennings. Were I Mr. Palmer, I'd have long since invested in earplugs or opened a vein.  Very fine film and most highly recommended.$
For all the rest that can be said about this beautiful film, there is one reason why I particularly love it: During the whole movie you see Emma Thompson portraying Elinor successfully as a young woman who deeply loves, but who chooses to conceal her own feelings so she will not bring reproach on herself or her loved ones, or even on less deserving people. Emma Thompson succeeds in conveying all of this in looks, small hesitations, subtle body language and never are we in disbelief. It all seems real and right, and you can truly believe that people never saw her feelings although at the same time you can see that they are real and very deep. I compare it for an example with Amanda Root's portrayal of Anne Elliott in Persuasion; I really had a hard time believing people did not see through her sad puppy eyes and sighs and nervous grabbing chairs and all these unsubtle ways she would play out Anne's inner torment. Anyway, to come back to Emma Thompson and Elinor, I know some people thought that her reaction at the end of the movie, when she finally learns that Edward is not married and that he wants to ask for her hand, is not really lady like and maybe even exaggerated. I could not agree less. This is the reaction of someone who has been loving and feeling and hurting for a long time, holding it in so she would hurt people around her the least possible; and on the moment of learning that finally, happiness is within her reach, that finally all this has not been for nothing, she just bursts out in uncontrollable crying and sobbing. I just could not hold my own tears when I saw the movie the first time, and believe me, I am not one to cry over sappy love stories usually. I just identified so much with her self-sacrifice of every moment for so long, which suddenly turned into too much happiness to hold inside. Wow! That, in and of itself, is one reason to see and cherish this version of Sense and Sensibility; and then there is so much more but I'll leave it at that!$
I saw this movie in a cinema back in 1996 and since that June I have seen it about a dozen times. It is true, that being an ardent lover of the so-called Romantic (as if the 13th century couldn't be Romantic or 17th, but these things are academic nonsense) period I can enjoy even minor pieces of period cinema, however this is most probably the best film set in the early 19th century. Although it centers on the relationship of the two sisters and their respective romantic relationships, it also seems to be a salute to the period itself in its precise description of the English country society. It is truthful to Jane Austen's novel, but Emma Thompson's script is fine in its own right, with many omissions and additions to the novel. The acting is superb, Kate Winslet as the typical Romantic dreamer (sensibility) is breathtaking (try not to be moved when her character wanders in the rain to see the house of her beloved and when she whispers half-deranged: 'Willoughby, Willoughby, Willoughby.') is perfect as is Emma Thompson as the rational but equally tormented older sister(sense). Greg Wise is perfect as the dashing semi-Byronic hero Willoughby and Allan Rickman as the mellow Brandon. To say nothing of the art direction, the music or the fantastic image composition. I would recommend everyone with some sort of emotional subtlety to see this film, for the story, the wit, the period and the imagery.$
I am not a fan of Jane Austen novels. And, after I wrote them and I saw adaptations of them, I am far to become one. But this version... . Obvious, it is different. In profound good sense. For the great performances. For the wise script. For a perfect director who knows the subtle art of storytelling. Short, a superb film. And the brilliant Emma Thompson working fine to her character and her story.$
I love Jane Austen, and I love period dramas. This film, while a little too long, was perfect for me. I loved it when I first saw it a year ago, and I still love it now. Sense and Sensibility is a great book by Miss Austen, and this film does the book justice, in my personal opinion. The film looks gorgeous, the camera-work, the locations and the costumes. The script sparkled with wit, subtlety, romance and heartache, especially when Marianne goes out into the rain and gets herself ill. The music is lovely also. The performances were exceptional. Period-film veteran Emma Thompson is lovely here as Elinor Dashwood, and Kate Winslet matches her perfectly in a beautifully-blended portrayal of the tragic Marianne. As for the men, they were very good too. Hugh Grant was exceedingly charming as the male lead, and I have read many reviews criticising Alan Rickman's acting.(not on IMDb though) He may have been older than Miss Austen intended, he was very good also as Colonel Brandon, but not as good as the other three. His style of acting is very suave and charismatic, like Sean Connery and George Sanders. If you've seen him in Robin Hood:Prince of Thieves you'll know what I mean. All in all, a lovely film, maybe not the best period drama, but has plenty of elements that makes it truly memorable. 9/10 Bethany Cox$
A totally engrossing story of the desperation of women to become subservient to men and take a master. Admittedly that was the expectation in those days, still is for far too many girls around the world but this kind of urgent determination to find a 'good' man to wait upon belongs in a museum along with some slave master statues. That aside, the acting, especially Emma Thompson is top notch, it's directed by a visionary and pioneer and it flows quite elegantly along with a poetic and humorous dialogue. Sadly, the only lessons to learn are those still being learnt some centuries later.$
Before The tigers crouched and the dragons hid, before the boys of Brokeback mountain, there was Ang Lee's masterpiece Sense and Sensibility, which I'm sure he won several Oscars for. It is probably the best adaptation of Sense and Sensibility you will ever see, with stellar performances by Kate Winslet, Hugh Grant and Emma Thompson, all who give award worthy emotions throughout the film. This was the movie that brought Kate Winslet her first Oscar nomination (and 1st Bafta win) and Emma Thompson her first award for best adapted screen play. This film is perfect in every way I do not even see the need to discuss the script. The backdrop and costumes are magnificent, as are the dialogues, situations and general feel of the entire pace and plot. A must see for everyone and anyone with good taste for awesome cinema!$
I have a weakness for movies derived from Jane Austen's novels -- I'll admit it. But this is a standout. Emma Thompson and Kate Winslet are perfectly cast as the two emotional opposites of the title with Hugh Grant as the aspiring clergyman who is the ultimate match to Emma Thompson's character and Alan Rickman as the colonel who captures Kate's character after the man she initially falls madly in love with marries someone else for her money. Ang Lee is the director. In her speech accepting the Golden Globes award for best screenplay (which she actually did write), Emma Thompson, imitating Jane Austen's style, called him "this foreign person" who turned out "to understand me better than I understood myself." As in all the Jane Austen movies that stay within the period, the English countryside is the gorgeous backdrop against which the romance plays out -- at least half of the film's beauty. In a sense, Jane Austen wrote only one novel again and again: young women search for love in a world where first sons inherit and younger sons are under pressure to marry wealth. The major female characters in Austen novels are genteel but lack dowries and so they must either find wealthy husbands, fall in love with second sons prepared to be disinherited for the sake of that love, follow the course of impropriety or resign themselves to spinsterhood. We are not shown genuine poverty (though one assumes that the many servants in Jane Austen's stories live less luxuriously than the "impoverished" families they loyally serve). Austen novels are invariably about the social interplay between the very, very wealthy and the genteel poor with a rake or two in the mix to tempt young women to disgrace themselves. Of their type, they are unsurpassed in English literature, and they make wonderful movies as both Hollywood and the British film industry have shown again and again by returning to the same fountain for yet another draught. This is one of the best.$

Four Rooms (1995)$
I really don't understand why this movie got such bad reviews!  Overall, this is a creative and refreshing movie.  It is not Pulp Fiction but it is still a good performance.  Tim Roth, especially, is the best thing in the film.  Out of the four I like Robert Rodguize's misbehavior the best.  The missing ingredient was indeed a bit cheesy but the rest are still above average performance.  If you are interested in this movie but discouraged by the movie critics, I ensure you that you won't regret seeing it.$
Four Rooms, the 4 part directed, 4 part written mix-matched movie turns out to be an awesome combination. With Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino working on this film, you seem to expect a trigger-happy film festival with plenty of bombs and explosives to spare. But what the final product turns out to be is a laugh-out-loud comedy which follows a bellhop's mishaps one night as he scrambles to keep his hotel in order. Tim Roth is always a great performer and in this movie there is no difference. Kudos indeed.$
In many senses, it is his film. Not only for the character - the same for each part - but for performance. A film like a puzzle. Not a comfortable one but amusing, ironic, giving the sign of four more than interesting directors and eccentric stories. Sure, it could be better. But , against critics, it remains a familiar reference for New Year films. Motifs - always subjectives. For me, the best from them remains the admirable performance of Tim Roth.$
Flaky, flippant substitute-bellhop in a run-down Hollywood hotel encounters a coven of comely witches, a psychotic man and his wife involved in sexual, violent role-playing, a gangster and his wife who need a babysitter for their precocious kids, and a wire-strung Hollywood auteur who proposes a bloody game of winner-take-all. Hinging on the unfunny results of Tim Roth's performance as the uniformed bellboy, this poorly-made, inconsistent, off-putting collage of eccentrics falls completely flat. Roth, who is not a rubber-faced comedian (but who hopes to be here), attempts a bon vivant air of light-hearted smugness that just seems perverse. The rest of the talented cast is either humiliated (Ione Skye, as a half-naked witch) or used for decoration or as a punch-line. Antonio Banderas' sleek, oily gangster is amusing, and the little kids are quite good, but their segment ends on an odious, completely inappropriate note--and yet nobody behind or in front of the camera wants to show any responsibility. The feeling is one of 'anything for a laugh', yet the writing is wincingly unfunny, and the four different directors are simply not in sync (not with each other nor with the material), particularly Quentin Tarantino, who stars in and directed the final segment and appears to be winging it. NO STARS.$
"Four Rooms" was a big flop in 1995, considering its hip roster of stars and directors. It's not very hard to see why. The first of the four sketches contains a shocking twist (we see the bare breasts of Ione Skye but only the bust of Madonna!), but serves no other purpose. The second is even worse - in fact, it's the worst of the lot. The third and the fourth are improvements; they are both extremely laborious, but at least the payoffs are good. Quentin Tarantino delivers one memorable Tarantino ("one-minute", though it's longer than that) speech; Tim Roth delivers a spastic, manic performance that is also memorable as a landmark in (deliberate?) bad acting. *1/2 out of 4.$
When I was in high school, anything Tarantino-related was required to be memorized. Yes, even this one was insisted upon in high school, though perhaps not as strongly as QT's first two. This portmanteau follows bellhop Tim Roth as he gets into several adventures over New Year's Eve. I remember liking this one quite a bit, but, viewing it now, it's just too uneven to be worthwhile. Anders' first segment is easily the low point, thankfully. Any film starring Madonna should be immediately suspect, and everything about this tale of witches is awful. Rockwell's segment is a bit of an improvement, but too forgettable. Rodriguez's segment is the one I remember being the best, and it thankfully does hold up okay. Antonio Banderas is hilarious in it, and most of the jokes hit. I remember QT's segment being the worst originally, but I actually thought it was by far the best this time around. It usually gets flack, I think, because it stars Tarantino, but he's comfortable here playing a pompous movie director. It's honestly his best performance (if it had been readily available, I might have suffered through Destiny Turns on the Radio again) and his direction is pretty brilliant. The one thing that really drags this whole movie down is Tim Roth. Man, I remember loving him when I was a teenager, and, though I criticized his performance in Reservoir Dogs above, he's on Olivier's level there compared to his awful mugging here. Even if QT's segment were the weakest, it would automatically be upgraded to the strongest just because he's the only one who settles Roth the crap down, a bit at least.$
Don't believe the glowing reviews. It's a completely unfunny piece of self-indulgent fluff. Tarantino apparently thought he could write comedy, but clearly he could not. And Tim Roth's "acting" here is embarrassing. I was rolling my eyes all the time, and not for good reasons.$
This movie was horrible. It was the worst movie I have seen since How High. Quentin has definitely redeemed himself since he made this movie. It was amazing to see such big named actors such as Bruce Willis and Antonio Banderas in this movie. The only reason I can see why they decided to play in this film was to give a fresh starting Quentin Tarantino a chance. This movie stunk so bad I can still smell it even after I returned it to the video store. This movie just didn't do anything. It was boring and flat from start to finish. Please do not rent this movie. Spend your money on some gum or a coke. You'll definitely be spending your money on something more meaningful.$
I really don't understand why this film hasn't got a better rating. I mean, it's got everything: Women, cars, weapons, alcohol and Tarantino. It's just style itsself which made this film. Seriously, Tim Roth is so damn good in this film, his acting, his expressions and his behavior, all is perfect. You can have a good laugh about without even following the storyline (which is worth doing that, but anyway). The film is profound and the and the different parts of it are linked. Great film.$
Even from the start, we have the Tarantino vibe here, although he's only partly responsible for the film. Different room, different writer/director. Tim Roth is to carry this film, and he really does get on your nerves, and even though he acts absurdly, over the top, off the wall, in a totally unrealistic (well, he's not the only one) character, it's what the role calls for, and in that context, he succeeds brilliantly. Watching him lose it, was the strongest moments. It's New Years Eve, and being the new bell boy, like the Gekko Brothers at The Titty Twister, Ted (don't call him Theodore) (Roth) he's got one hell of a night ahead of him. Lets start with the covern (not oven) of witches, where we get to see Ione's Skye's slightly pathetic boobs. A ceremony of bologne is in in the waiting. This is the weakest one of the four stories. Things get weirder and much more intense, as we move onto the lover's quarrel, where poor Ted as just having pashed Ione Skye, hits more serious waters, unwittingly getting in the middle, of this mad couple problems of infidelity, where the husband holds Teddy at gunpoint. Finally surviving these two nutjobs, where we do have a second serve from one of them (the less threatening) later on, we move onto The Misbehavers which provide a bizarre and stylishly different scenario, I liked, where finally we come to the main story we've all been waiting for, about a director, played by.... have a guess? and his entourage, who really set a good example of what stupid things people do, when they're drunk, minus a pinkie. Tarantino really steals the moments here, acting not like an actor, but a director acting like a director with a lot of CU shots, where his presence holds are complete attention. He's eloquent and his body language is fantastic. I just love watching him trying to act, but he's just being him, comparing movie's what not. He shows up the other writers with his input of dialogue, though of course, more suited behind a camera, despite his awesome confidence in front of it. Yes, that was the worst club sandwich I've ever seen too. Four Rooms is certainly different with same truly impressive performances, which I will note because they deserve credit, beside Roth who's wonderful of course. Refer by Surname: Skye, Proval, Beals especially, Wills especially, Banderas, Tomei. If a QT fan, don't pass it off. It's animation in the opening credits is a killer.$

Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls (1995)$
I like the bit when he comes out of the rhinos butt$
In this sequel to the very popular "Ace Ventura: Pet Detective", Ace is in Africa getting into all sorts of silly nonsense. "Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls" is definitely a guilty pleasure. While the film is very stupid and never tries to be anything else, it DID make me laugh...much like films like "Waterboy" and "Stepbrothers". A couple of the dumbest scenes had me almost falling on the floor laughing...such as when Ace gets spears in his legs and the scene where he's inside a fake rhino! Hardly intellectual faire....but funny. A great film to watch with friends....especially the sort of friends whose favorite DVDs don't come from the Criterion Collection!$
One of the best and my favorite comedy movies ever! I have watched it at least 7 times and found it funny each time. All those guys saying this part is not as good as the first one, must be out of their sense of humor! This part lives up to its expectations and i found it even funnier than the first part. You might get bored watching the first part 3 or 4 times but not this part! This is a must see film if you haven't seen it already. I own its DVD and keep it very close to my DVD player all the times...never know when i'd like to watch it again :-) I would give it a well deserving 10 out of 10, it cant get any better than this. I really feel sorry for those who didn't find it funny. Please Don't miss it...watch it today!!! Highly recommended!!!!$
Without any shame I say : I love this film. Jim Carrey is a great comedian in my opinion and the Ace Ventura films remain his best and funniest achievements. I recommend this film to everyone who needs a good laugh when they're stressed or something. It's true : Ace makes you forget all your daily problems. I can't count the times I couldn't stop laughing. The story...let's say that's not very important but there's is a plot. To avoid a war between 2 African tribes, Ace has got to find back the sacred animal which is a big white bat. To do this, Ace gets stuck in a giant fake rhino, has to do a survival test made up by savages and infiltrate in the high society levels. I assure you this all turns into hilarious situations. I'm not saying it's better than part one, but it sure is more light-headed and there's much more variation. For the rest, all the elements that made Ace Ventura 1 so good, are present. And tons of it !!! Jim Carrey is a rather limited comedian. Either you love him or you can't stand him. If you love him, and his rubber face expressions, this film ( and the first of course ) are the best to check out. He'll probably never win an Oscar or end up in the "best actor ever"-list but I don't care. And I'm sure all other fans of this film don't care, neither$
Shikaka! Ace Ventura is one of my favorite movie characters of all time! This character catapulted Jim Carrey from small TV character actor from 'In Living Color', to A-list celebrity, when the film, 1994's Ace Ventura: Pet Detective became a surprise hit. The first movie was such a hit, it spawn a somewhat funny animated television series (1995 to 2000) and one really bad 2009 spin-off children movie, Ace Ventura, Jr.: Pet Detective. The best from all of these films, had to be the 1995 sequel, Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls. This film has developed a large cult following since its release and I agree with them. This movie in my opinion, is probably the funniest Jim Carrey's movie in the 1990s. Yes, I said it! Jim Carrey reprises his role as the title character Ace Ventura, a detective who specializes in retrieval of tame and captive animals. This time, Ace Ventura is heading to Africa, to recover a sacred bat stolen from poachers, before two African tribes go to war because of it. Directed by Steve Oedekerk, the movie did a great job in location. I really thought, the movie was filmed in some type of Africa country. Actually, the film shot in various locations in and around Charleston, South Carolina, San Antonio, Texas and British Columbia, Canada. Who knew! The writing for this film is just amazing. Not only is the jokes, more hits than misses to the funny bone, but it's very clever with its gross out puns/sight gags, pop culture references, and movie parody humor of previous films like 1993's Cliffhanger. The crime solving mystery of the film is also pretty brilliant. You really get into the story, as Ace Ventura recover clue after clue. The best highlight of the film is Jim Carrey's acting. The way, he can move his body in a silly way for slapstick humor was astonishing. In his day, nobody could touch this guy for pure facial and voice comedy. You can tell that Carrey is having the time of his life just ad-libbing and winging it. Yes, he did overact, a bit here and became more like a cartoon than a person, but his overacting as Ace made it, very entertaining. This was Jim Carrey in his prime. He was and still is a mad genius at making people laughs, but lately hasn't found good material and tamed done since then. If there was any reason to watch this film, it's for his performance here. You'll find yourself, laughing more than once. I remember my whole family were crying, unable to breath with laughter the first time watching this. Spank you very much, Ace Ventura for making me laugh. The main theme song is pretty catchy by Robert Folk. The movie does a great job using establish songs like 'Secret Agent Man' &amp; 'Lion Sleeps Tonight' to add to the humor. Indeed, the movie did come with alternative versions, when aired in syndication in International countries and on television. In order to receive a PG certificate, the UK release of the film features a number of cuts, equaling one minute and 35 seconds for the theatrical release, plus a further three seconds when re-classified for home video. This version is the worst, as it cut really funny scenes like Bumblebee tuna balls joke, and alternative version of the 'rhino scene'. Don't watch this version. Just find the US standard. Nature Calls does have considerably less offensive swearing, sexual jokes, and vulgarity than the previous film, but it doesn't really affects the quality of the film. Yes, there was Product Placement. An obvious ad of Subway is placed on a highway billboard early in When Nature Calls, but it was used as a gag about being in nature. The pacing is a bit off for a 90 minute film. Honestly, they could have cut like the whole first 15 minutes as it takes him forever to get to Africa and the story to start. None of the first part in the Himalayas and Tibet were that funny to begin with. The supporting cast was a bit missing. The female lead, the Princess (Sophie Okonedo) was barely in the film, and just there for somebody for Ace to bang with. It's a far cry from big female leads of Courtney Cox and Sean Young from the last movie. At less, this movie get a really good funny supporting character name Oda (Maynard Eziashi) that made scenes way funny. Ian McNeice as Fulton Greenwall &amp; Bob Gunton as Burton Quinn &amp; Simon Callow really did work, well as the straight man stock characters to Jim Carrey's outrageous cartoon character. Even fellow 'In Living Color' cast member, Tommy Davidson, got a few laughs in, as the Tiny Warrior. Overall: It's a movie that you find yourself, rewatching it time after time, because it's so funny. You'll find yourself repeating the funny phrases and wisecracks. Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls is a must watch, must have, film to add to your comedy collection.$
Steve Oedekerk might be a talented film-maker(when I say might, I mean exactly that; I've seen no other movies by him, I plan on doing so soon, though), but he's no Tom Shadyac, and this film very much shows that. The humor in the first one was at times crude, but mostly civil(nothing you felt really crossed the line, in my opinion). In this one, it's flat-out disgusting; it's very, very crude, mostly has to do with bodily fluids, and there's too many sex jokes for my tastes(and bad ones at that). The film really has very little to offer for anybody but the biggest of Carrey fans(I am a big fan of him myself, and I found this film hard to sit through). Another problem is that it borrows too much material from the first; every good joke is copied directly from the first(several lines are exactly the same), and the movie tries too hard to make you laugh at things that aren't actually funny. I also found the disrespect and mocking towards the tribes fairly insulting; while they may not be civilized, these people are hardly lesser humans, as this film makes them out to be. Another thing I despised was the way they changed Carrey's character to the worse; in the first, he was eccentric, mildly annoying, but mostly funny, and somewhat smart, actually. In this one, he's just annoying, arrogant, childish and, well, completely pathetic. We're supposed to laugh at this character, but how can we possibly laugh when he's so utterly annoying? He was somewhat immature in the first, but here, he's like a spoiled brat. It really seemed like the director didn't get the point of the first film at all; Ace Ventura isn't funny because he's a pathetic loser; he's funny because he's eccentric yet smart, and he somehow manages to be appealing, though he is like a grown child. It's like Oedekerk just took all of the lesser points of the first film, magnified them, put in some of the good, and released it. The plot is less interesting than the first, the mystery is less involving, as both are obviously pushed into the background to allow for the "humor" instead. I also thought that the humor seemed far too forced and overdone; not one single joke was "minor" or a "detail". No, you have to show something completely ridiculous, and hope the audience finds it funny. One thing that I also have to mention is the special effects; they are truly horrible. I know that it shouldn't matter in a comedy, but come on, every single effect looked so fake. And who's decision was it to make that damn little ape appear in every other scene? It's not like it had a major part in the first movie, after all. It had as little a role in the first as any of the other animals. If they were going to bring back characters from the first, why not bring back some of the ones that work well with Carrey and his character; like Emilio, or Woodstock, or even Melissa. They were actually entertaining, unlike the supporting cast of this film. All in all, a very average film, and not really worthy as a sequel to the much better first film. I recommend this only to the biggest of Carrey fans, and possibly fans of Steve Oedekerk too. 5/10$
WHO really cares what the plot, setting and other characters are like in this movie? They're boring if you're really interested, but the only reason this movie was made was for audiences to see  Jim Carrey's insane character again. And he is absolutely hilarious. The stand out scene has him driving through the African jungles singing Chitty Chitty Bang Bang to his furious companion and intentionally hurling the jeep into the air before crashing into the spot he wants...."LLLLLLLLLlike-a-glove!!!" Then he goes into the party in the country house, and messes about endlessly, and it's obvious Carrey was in a really silly mood for most of this. Okay, the movie is absolute garbage. But Jim Carrey is absolutely hilarious, and this confirms him as the Funniest Person Of All Time. Surely worth watching for that.$
Jim Carrey stars again as Ace Ventura in this fly by night sequel whose script looks like it was pounded out in a day.. While the first one was crude and funny ..this one is just crude..hardly any laughs at all.. it just seems tired and you just want it to end..on a scale of one to ten...2$
Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls (1995): Dir: Steve Oedekerk / Cast: Jim Carrey, Ian McNeice, Simon Callow, Sophie Okonodo, Bob Gunton: Dumb comedy about the union between man and animals and the stand to preserve wildlife. It opens with a parody of Cliffhanger where Ace Ventura fails to save a raccoon stranded on a mountainside. Depressed, he secludes himself in a temple until he is summoned to Africa to find the sacred bat thus preventing a war between two tribes. Basically the same stupid concept as Ace Ventura: Pet Detective that devises predictable developments and recycled dialogue. The tribal jokes are offensive but director Steve Oedekerk allows for beautiful shots of Africa that are pretty much the best aspect of the film. In fact, watching ninety minutes of African footage on your average wildlife program would be better time spent than watching this. Jim Carrey does nothing new accept portray Ace as a bigger jackass. Ian McNeice is wasted as Ace's contact. Simon Callow plays the villain whose final scene has him molested by a gorilla. Sophie Okonodo plays the tribal Princess who encounters Ventura and allows him to pop her cherry before her wedding. This has him chased away from the village in a manner that many critics of this film may of felt. Serves only as a lame sequel and with all its idiotic mayhem it's a wonder why anyone would want to hear nature call. Score: 3 / 10$

Money Train (1995)$
So glad I bought this buddy money pot of a buddy cop film! Starring the delightful Woody Harrelson and Wesley Snipes in a fun banter extravaganza and heist awesomeness! This definitely has its flaws but the pros outweigh everything. Chris Cooper is a great villain and Joseph Ruben directed a nice ballbusting experience! Also Donald Robertson (Robert Blake) was great as the jerk boss cop.$
This is one of Wesley Snipes best (in my opinion), with great action scenes, an awesome finale and an amazing performance from Wesley Snipes!. All the characters are fantastic, and the story is really cool, plus Wesley Snipes is simply amazing in this!, and Woody Harrelson is fantastic!. Wesley and Woody had fantastic chemistry together, and i was really surprised, by how much i enjoyed the film!, plus Jennifer Lopez surprised me, by giving a very good performance!. Robert Blake is excellent as the dick, i hated him, and i thought, it had some great humor as well!, plus the ending is hilarious. You really get to see Snipe's incredible Martial art abilities, and the fight scenes are awesome!, plus one of my favorite scenes is when Snipes and Lopez have a boxing match, it was quite amusing!. Snipes and Lopez had great chemistry together, and it's very well made as well!, plus i thought Snipe's acting was fantastic!. This is one of Wesley Snipes best (in my opinion), with great action scenes, an awesome finale, and amazing performance from Wesley Snipes!, and i say it's a must see!. The Direction is great!. Joseph Ruben does a great job! here, with excellent camera work, awesome angles,and keeping the film at a very fast pace!. The Acting is fantastic!. Wesley Snipes is amazing as always, and is amazing here, he is extremely likable, hilarious had wonderful chemistry with Woody Harrelson, kicked that ass, had loads of charisma, seemed to be enjoying himself, never really took himself seriously, and was just amazing overall! (Snipes Rules!!!!!). Woody Harrelson is fantastic here, he is extremely hilarious had wonderful chemistry with Snipes,like Snipes seemed to be enjoying himself, had a great sense of humor, and once again him and Snipes made a terrific pair! (Woody rules). Jennifer Lopez is stunningly gorgeous!, and does very well with what she had to do, i was quite surprised, she also had great chemistry with Snipes. Robert Blake is great as the prick, i hated his guts, and cheered out loud when he got punched and arrested!. Chris Cooper is extremely creepy in his role, and was quite menacing. Bill Nun is great in his cameo (Nunn Rules!). Rest of the cast do fine. Overall a must see!. **** out of 5$
Personally speaking, I don't quite know what to make of this picture. I saw it again on late night cable the other night and I was laughing hysterically throughout. Wesley and Woody play two brothers (!) who work as transit cops. Woody's a gambling junkie with a huge debt on his back while Wesley plays the straight man who's getting a little tired of constantly having to bail his brother out. Desperate, Woody plans to hijack the Money Train that rides along to each station, collecting the night's collections. Folks, believe me when I tell you that it actually gets more ridiculous. Add to the mix a pyromaniac token booth bandit, a pre-lobotomy Jennifer Lopez, Robert Blake in a performance so hammy that you can almost smell the bacon coming from your tv, action sequences that are unabashedly ridiculous and you have yourself... Money Train. My favorite moment comes when Robert Blake, after having been informed of the possibility of civilian casualties if the hijacked Money Train continues to speed ahead on the local line, responds with the now-classic line, "That's what we live with." I was laughing so hard that tears were squirting out of my eyes. This movie is utterly ridiculous yet strangely riveting. Wesley Snipes plays his usual cocky, confident self and it seems to me that he won't accept a role these days unless he gets to kick someone in the face. Woody Harrelson looks like he smoked one too many blunts in this one. I actually prefer his character here over Wesley's and that's not saying much. Jennifer Lopez looks damn good but I can't help but think how stupid she is in real life. I really don't know where else to go with this review other than to recommend watching it. You might like it but not because it's quality stuff but because it'll cheer you up, it's so bad. Actual rating ** out of ***** but on the laugh-o-meter I'll give it a full **** out of *****.$
Money Train (1995): Dir: Joseph Ruben / Cast: Wesley Snipes, Woody Harrelson, Jennifer Lopez, Robert Blake, Chris Cooper: Title suggests theft in that the money is the riches and the train is the getaway. Unfortunately viewers missed that train and had to suffer through the entire film. Wesley Snipes and Woody Harrelson who previously starred in White Men Can't Jump are brothers and undercover cops in the subway area. Snipes looks out for adopted brother Harrelson who is constantly in trouble due to debt. Jennifer Lopez joins them thus causing romantic divisions. Trouble arises when Harrelson decides to rob the money train leading to an ending that applauds theft. Basically another buddy flick, with director Joseph Ruben handling the action effectively without a screenwriter anywhere to be evident. Snipes and Harrelson recite tired formulas where nothing is learned. Why this film could not concentrate more on their adopted relationship is beyond me. Instead it is more or less an excuse to pair the actors up again in hopes of repeating previous success. Lopez is a romantic prop with little purpose here other than to unintentionally cause a brief division between the duo cops. Robert Blake is forgettable as the foul mouth ranting supervisor. Message of theft and brotherhood sidelined for pure nonsense. Viewers should let this train wreck pass them by. Score: 3 / 10$
Enjoyed this film because of its location in NYC and the fact that transit cops were depicted. If you have to travel on the Transit System in NYC you will enjoyed this film even more, because it mentions all kinds of Subway Stops, and there is plenty of action down below. Wesley Snipes,(John),"7 Seconds",'05, plays a real cool cop who has become very close friends with his co-worker, Woody Harrelson,(Charlie),"North Country",'05 and manages to steal Charlie's girl friend, Jennifer Lopez,(Grace Santiago),"Monster-in-Law",'05. Grace and John burn up the bed sheets with hot torrid love scenes. Robert Blake,(Donald Patterson),"Lost Highway",'97, plays a great jerk who is in charge of a train, called the Money Train. Great acting, lots of comedy and more than plenty of action. Enjoy$
Why everyone is so mad about this movie! It's not that bad! I'm sure, the actors and the director Joseph Ruben (He's one of my favorite ones) do a good job, especially Jennifer Lopez (She's so hot!). Well, of course that film had to borrow a lot from Andrei Konchalovsky's masterpiece Runaway Train, but anyway, that's a good action thriller.$
Employed as transit cops and unappreciated by their moody boss, two foster brothers contemplate hijacking a revenue train in this action comedy starring Wesley Snipes and Woody Harrelson. The chemistry between the leads is great as they share excellent banter as well as heartfelt moments together and one truly gets the sense of the pair having grown up with one another despite (of course) looking very different. The rest of the film though is far less remarkable. Chris Cooper has an excellent turn as a malevolent pyromaniac who constantly eludes the brothers, but he is oddly relegated to a mere subplot with the second half of the film powered by the ongoing question or whether they will or will not attempt to rob the train. A love triangle that develops with Jennifer Lopez as fellow cop does not really work either, though there is a curiously edited sequence that needs to be seen for itself in which one brother making love to her is cut against the other being beat up. If a mixed bag overall, 'Money Train' is at least an entertaining film while it lasts. The majority of action scenes are very well filmed and the two brothers remain very likable throughout, flaws and all.$
Money Train is a great popcorn movie and Snipes and Harrison once again show the chemistry that makes a good buddy movie.  The script is fast-paced and clever and Jennifer Lopez is as beautiful and sexy as always.  This film is a true "sleeper hit" and is well worth the effort to catch-up with if you missed it the first time around.$

Get Shorty (1995)$
Barry Sonnenfeld was and maybe wasn't the right choice to make Get Shorty. He's a great visualist, and his films (Adams Family, Men in Black) are also very funny, but it's hard to say whether or not another director might've taken Elmore Leonard's sly comic novel more seriously or with less depth. As it is, however, Get Shorty is a cool little treat that doesn't over-stay its welcome, and provides its cast a plethora of witty dialog.  John Travolta brings on some sharp attitude, knowing the angles and wanting, as his character Chili Palmer, to get into Hollywood and out of loan sharking. Gene Hackman's funny as a fledgling producer with his first, true big hit in his lap.  And supporting parts from Delroy Lindo, Renne Russo, Danny De Vito (as 'Hollywood' as you'll ever see him), and James Gandolfini, are all very worthy.  It's a worthwhile watch, with a dead-on score from John Lurie.  But I would reccomend Out of Sight or Jackie Brown to Leonard fans looking for a great adaptation.  It's a very good Hollywood picture (reflective of what it's about), though it's not a masterpiece.  A-$
Smart, funny mobster comedy/satire based on the novel by Elmore Leonard. Travolta is well-cast in one of his very best roles as a slick Miami loan shark/enforcer who travels to Los Angeles to cash in a loan, but instead ends up teaming with B-movie writer/producer Hackman to fulfill his dream of being connected to the movie business. Before he can however, he must deal with bumbling mobsters, white-collar criminals, and the anxiety of trying to find the right leading man. Crackling, hilarious dialogue, well-drawn characters, and clever insight into the movie business run rampant in this snappy little comedy. Maybe not for all tastes, but well-made and a definite must for Travolta fans. ***$
One of the great mysteries of all time, right up there with Area 51 and the Da Vinci Code, is why the film industry, now into its second century and -- as you read this -- consuming on a relative basis more bandwidth than any other form of media, cannot produce consistently decent product? Now don't misunderstand. This is not to say that most movies are inherently bad, for that is not true either. However one of the dirty little secrets of the industry is that the "breakout" ratio is around 20:1. That is, for every 19 forgettable products that are churned out -- products that keep the cable and streaming media pipelines full, and keep food on the table for all the electricians, caterers, and Best Boys -- about one actually is memorable enough to attract a permanent audience or become near-iconic. Not a very efficient ratio! The late Marshall McLuhan tried in his lifetime to develop the notion of "media ecology," essentially the premise that the cultural output of a society was no less important than any other industry output, and therefore an effort should be made NOT TO WASTE THE RESOURCES or (simply put) produce junk. Like the infamous joke about about the "Nietzsche graffiti" (first line: "God is dead - Nietzsche." Second line: "Nietzsche is dead. God") that attempt did not turn out so well. McLuhan is gone, and the ratio has arguably gotten worse, because there are now many more pipelines to fill. Which brings us, belatedly, to GET SHORTY, not only a great film (one of Travolta's best performances, so effortless you wonder if he phoned it in, and Pixar just added a body) but one of Hollywood's most "inside" scripts ever. (Comedians have "inside jokes." Hollywood has "inside scripts.") The premise here is that the making of a movie has little to do with the movie, and everything to do with egos and business capabilities of the people making it. The idea that a professional mobster could stumble into Hollywood and suddenly realize that making a film is no different than planning a hit, or a robbery, is sheer brilliance. And very close to home. In the history of the medium, it is one of the only movies to deal with the delicate (and unpopular) issue of ... why so many bad films have to be made, simply to produce one good one...?$
GET SHORTY (1995) ***1/2 John Travolta, Gene Hackman, Rene Russo, Danny De Vito, Delroy Lindo, Dennis Farina, James Gandolfini, David Paymer, Martin Ferrero, Bette Midler, Linda Hart, Bobby Slayton,  Harvey Keitel (cameo), Penny Marshall (cameo).  Funny and entertaining adaptation of Elmore Leonard's crime novel about Chili Palmer (Travolta, perfectly charming) a loan shark from Miami who heads out to LA after a pay cheat and winds up in Hollywood teaming up with horror schlock producer Hackman and B-film screamer Russo pitching a story and avoiding some not-so-pleasant criminal types along the way.  Great satire and excellently keen in keeping Leonard's dialogue intact with some dead-on spoofing of Tinsel Town in particular De Vito as a Method actor run amok.  Look for director Barry Sonnenfeld as a parking valet and also the real Chili Palmer as one of Farina's dinner companions at the film's pre-credit sequence prior to Travolta punching out Farina.$
There are a thousand funny moments in this movie and everyone gives a great performance, especially Rene Russo, who is at her best.  The best scene is when Travolta goes to the movies to see "A Touch of Evil" and knows the text by heart.  A genuinely good movie, which anyone would enjoy watching, at least once.$
I like the bit where the debt collector would always say look at me$
Get Shorty is a hilariously funny, brilliantly written and colorfully acted satire of how hard it is to get a Hollywood movie made. All the moving pieces and different parties, each with their own motivations and goals, make it a natural fit for a film-loving gangster. Leonard is the man, as the movie totally depends on his script, and every part of it is awesome (dialogue, characters, story webbing).$

Copycat (1995)$
Definitely a film that will have you on the edge of your seat, if not hugging it as closely as possible.  Copycat tells the story of a serial killer psychologist(wonderfully played by Sigourney Weaver), slowly working her way from phobias due to an attack from a serial killer, working with the law(serviceably played by a cute Holly Hunter) in search of a serial killer that kills in the previous styles of former serial killers.  The murderer uses old photos and the books of Weaver to recapture the "essence" of each brutal killing.  Murders are done ala Albert DeSalvo, Son of Sam, Ted Bundy, Jeffrey Dahmer, and others.  The film is very fascinating and yet very twisted too.  The killer is played with such conviction by William McNamara. Another killer in prison(the one that attacked Weaver) is played with unusual repulsivenes by Harry Connick Jr.  The real star here is the script which has unusual intelligence for such subject matter.  There is a good deal of violence, yet a subtle humour pervades much of the discussion between the cops and even Weaver and Hunter in a few scenes.  But the thrill aspect of the film...the raw suspense...steers the picture from beginning to end.  Hunter and Weaver(particularly) do incredible jobs in their roles, and I was impressed with the film as a whole.$
Sigourney Weaver plays Dr. Helen Hudson, a retired psychiatrist that specializes in serial killers. Hudson is agoraphobic and suffers with different degrees of stress and depression. Holly Hunter and Dermot Mulroney are detectives trying to catch a serial killer. Harry Connick, Jr. plays a serial killer behind bars and taunts Hudson as she tries to help the investigators. The killer wants his own fame for duplicating famous murders. The background score will help your nerves jitter. Hunter is not convincing as a police officer. Mulroney's character is as bold as cardboard. Connick, Jr. is quite funny in a cynical way. Weaver conveyed her character's fear and anxiety. And without a change of expression, was bribed out of a pair of her frilly panties in exchange for information about the killer's identity. Dim the lights and enjoy.$
I missed this when it first came out. I thought it was a copycat serial killer movie that was in fashion then. It came as a surprise then. Perhaps time has ripened it then. It was surprisingly gripping and gritty. I held my attention. I couldn't tell it was almost 20 years old.$
This is the BEST thriller ever made. I know, everyone will crucify me for saying this, but I was bored by much of "Se7en." I think that "Copycat" is far superior. As for "Silence of the Lambs," comparisons - yes they are similar (with one convicted killer aiding people in catching another killer at large), and "Lambs," is naturally amazing (it deserved its Oscar), though it is not as scary as "Copycat." For some reason, "Copycat" struck the right chord with me. The small details of the killings are so clever and creepy, and they add to the atmosphere wonderfully. Sigourney Weaver is in one of the greatest roles of her career (though she is always fantastic), as is the remarkable Holly Hunter (who also provides some humor). Dermot Mulroney, William McNamara and Harry Connick Jr. round out the fine cast. However, in addition to the powerful female leads, it is the story that drives this movie. I was so hooked by it, and every twist had me on the edge of my seat. It is both terrifying AND well-made. And the score! I can't even begin to say how beautiful and haunting the music is. This is one movie I am very happy to own.$
This is not even close to Silence of the Lambs. In fact, it has so many plot holes and logical inconsistencies that 6 - 6.5 rating is generous. Acting was good but character development was sparse. We get no background on why this kid kills. He just does. And, the all-knowing psychologist who surmises that he has technical lab job, can't figure out that he has access to sperm samples and get police over to IVF labs? Really? The most unbelievable part of Copycat is that the Dr. gets attacked multiple times in her apt yet police put a single,bumbling officer outside her door time and time again. The movie has some suspense but it is not even close to top thrillers of all-time. Too highly rated on Amazon and by many here..$

Assassins (1995)$
This movie is very entertaining and has appropriate amount of action and suspense. The action sequences are great and the interactions between Stallone and Banderas excellent. If you're a fan of action films, this one is definitely worth a watch.$
Sylvester Stallone and Antonio Banderas star in this great action-thriller.  Sylvester Stallone plays Robert Rath, who is supposed to kill this guy at a funeral, but someone beats him to it.  He tracks the man and has a nice little talk with him.  The other man is another assassin, Miguel Bain (Antonio Banderas).  Rath (who is the best assassin there is) gets another assignment worth two million dollars.  Eliminate buyers and return girl and disk and he can retire.  Bain wants to beat Rath and complete the task first.  What follows is a battle between the two assassins.  Sylvester Stallone looks sleepy, at one time they show a close-up of his eyes and Julianne Moore's eyes.  You can see the difference so easily.  Banderas is alive, which is good.  The best performance is probably from Julianne Moore who is the girl they have to get the disk from.  Special effects are good, as is the ending climax.  Overall, it is thrilling, with a fair amount of action and violence.$
Sylvester Stallone, Antonio Banderas, and Julianne Moore star in this action movie: a battle of hit men. Stallone has had so many bad roles before, but this is one of the better roles I've seen him in. He would follow it five years later with a similar role in Get Carter. However, a real hit-man would not have hesitated to waste a woman. Antonio Banderas seemed out of character as an assassin. He was way over the top with emotional outbursts and impatience. These seem highly uncharacteristic of a successful assassin on his way up. Julianne Moore's character changed from a calm, cool bad girl into a helpless, bumbling female after meeting Stallone. How convenient! Many Of Richard Donner's other films have similar problems. However, there is enough enjoyable action, development and tension to enjoy the movie, as long as you suspend a lot of belief ...a lot of belief. *** of 4 stars.$
I thought this was a great action flick. I'm really into this genre of movies. I don't particularly like Sylvester Stallone but he was pretty good in this movie. Julianne Moore was good but I think she would've been better if her role was bigger. But I think Antonio Banderas stole the show. He was so good as the psychopathic assassin. I loved the chase scenes. Especially the scene in the taxi. Miguel Bain's (Banderas) evilness just oozed out of him as this scene played. Robert Rath (Stallone) wanted to kill Bain so bad during this scene. I loved the explosions. I just had a thought though. Whenever Rath blew Bain out of the window and then it showed Bain in the bathtub, shouldn't he have had more wounds than it showed? I don't know. Maybe it was just me. Anyways. This movie had violence but not as much as most movies in this genre does. I thought it had just enough. The ending was pretty good. It seemed like Bain just would not die. An invincible villain! How many times have you seen that in these kinds of movies? Well, I don't have much more to say about this film except I really enjoyed it and thanks for reading my review! Bye!$
Despite appearing as a basic action film, Assassins actually has a lot of suspense. The direction is probably the best part of this. Everything feels like it has high stakes and the pace is slow but rewarding. It never explodes into a big messy fight as the characters' actions are always very planned and precise.$
This movie is really about removing that which is old to replace it with something that is new. Robert (Sylvester Stallone) is an assassin working for the US government. Fifteen years previously he assassinated his mentor Nicholai as he was leaving a bank so that he could become number one. Now a younger assassin, Miguel (Antonio Banderas) has appeared and he wants Robert's position. This movie is an action movie and is quite good. Donner creates a very dreamlike feel to the movie, which possibly means that what we have is not always going to be there. Personally that is just a wild guess. The bigger theme in the movie is the fear that somebody younger will appear that is much better than you and thus making you obsolete. The world in the movie is one of assassins, but this is very much true in the business world where the older people have to keep on their toes with the younger executives who want their job. Then there are the conservative established companies who are being challenged by the new innovative companies. Assassins portrays life, a life where we must watch out for the ambitious coming up from below us and remain alert as they attempt to take from us the position that they want. Yet there is also a time when we want to retire, when we wish to give up, and the thing assassins says is that we can never retire because even if we give up the race, the race always seeks to come along and forcefully remove us. Assassins is done in a dreamlike state because it is a reflection of the world in which we live.$

Powder (1995)$
Powder is a beautiful story and I liked where it was set, Wizard of Oz style, in the American farm heartlands, much as so much good sci fi has been. Must be some sort of affinity there. If Powder is an example it is well deserved. Forgive me if it is in Canada. Beside the point, Lance Herikson is a highly balanced character, well played. There are other mountainous good characters as well, all played well. Great effects, a surprise. Why am I only just hearing of this masterpiece! Important sci fi and an easy 10 from me.$
I have not seen any of Victor Salva's movies before until now. He is also the director of the recent horror film Jeepers Creepers. The actors are all quite good: Mary Steenburgen as the woman that tries to help, Lance Henriksen as the local sheriff, Jeff Goldblum as the science teacher, and especially Sean Patrick Flanery as Powder. The movie can be classified in a number of ways: uplifting drama, family picture, and horror. There are strong moments of absolute emotional power, beauty, and humanity as Powder tries to fit in amongst the local people, but ends up teaching them lessons about humanity instead. Powder's appearance seemed even Chaplin-like at times, emoting with the slightest variances in expressions like a mime. Like many uplifting family movies, Powder was hard to find. I had never heard of it before and wonder if it was ever in theaters even. I don't think the script was developed enough and it was a bit predictable at times. I would rate it a PG-13 movie because of the intensity in some scenes and innuendo in the bullying. Teenagers, who feel they don't fit in, will strongly identify with Powder and will probably love this movie. However, this is also a horror movie, but a different kind of horror movie. At first it seems to follow in Carrie's shoes, setting up a revenge plot. But the horror we see isn't a misfit student getting revenge in unspeakable ways on classmates. It's in the town's inability to treat Powder with humanity. *** of 4 stars.$
It is rare that I see a movie as unforgettable and unpredictable as Powder. I am not a man who is easily impressed with special affects, but in this movie the affects always served a purpose instead of covering up the fact that there was no purpose. In an age where movies have become multiple scenes of graphic violence and corny excuses for stories, Powder is refreshing, filled with the meaning of humanity, and moved me to tears throughout the entire film. With most films, I am able to predict exactly what will happen and when. With Powder I could never quite tell what was going to happen next, and the ending was something I would have never imagined would happen and could only be described as extraordinary. There are so many elements to this movie: The paranormal; the challenge to everything we think we know about science and the capabilities of the human mind; the human capacity for cruelty; love and forgiveness; and the hope that our own humanity will one day advance beyond our own technology. Most of all, the raw emotion of this great masterpiece reaches deep into the heart and leaves an impression that stays with you. This is one of those rare movies that you will never forget, a true classic that illustrates truths about humanity that have existed since the beginning of time.$
The movie 'Powder' is a return to innocence. It possesses a spiritual quality that opens the eyes to life. And it lends a soothing note to those questions for which their seems to be more questions and few answers. Sean Patrick Flannery's performance was so powerful that one could actually feel the unconditional love within the heart and soul of the character that he played. The concepts that were brought forward, the passion that came with every dramatic scene, and the sense of realism and truth made it one of the most thought provoking movies of all time. Powder was not based on a true story, but it is, I feel, everybody's true story in some way, and it is as powerful, passionate, and inspirational as any true story I have ever seen. Some viewers may wish to begrudge the apparent perfection portrayed by the lead character. However, his only perfection was the way he searched so deep, often at great personal expense, for the suppressed perfection in everyone, and the hidden perfection in everything. I was somewhat disappointed by how the family quality of the movie was spoiled by the use of language by the school bully. Still, a must see for anybody who enjoys a thought provoking film once in a while. Even if you're a person who would prefer to sit down with a good book, as am I, the movie 'Powder' is definitely worth your time. In conclusion: 'Powder' is one of my favourite movies of all time. Seconded, in my opinion, only to 'The Boondock Saints'; also starring Sean Patrick Flannery.$
A story that encapsulates where we as a race are heading for a very bad outcome indeed. As clearly stated in the film by Jeff Goldblum's character, " when technology surpasses humanity". We as a species are in severe danger and crisis over how we perceive what our lives are truly about. We are losing our humanity by advancements in our technology that serve only to relieve us of harnessing our one true purpose that makes us unique within our humanity........Choice. The film also shows that a pure and unique individual is not accepted within those who are already lost of their own humanity. I find myself relating to 'powder' in many ways, albeit minus his physical and other obvious electrical abilities. But I do understand his humanity and choice to make humane decisions that do affect all of us. And his feeling of isolation and not 'fitting in' to his fellow kind. Hopefully one day we can be at a point where our humanity will rise above our technological demands, otherwise we are on a roller-coaster ride to self destruction. Good film,good message.$
I honestly can't understand why some people disliked, or even hated this movie. I absolutely adore this movie. I think the acting is great (but then I again, I happen to love both Jeff Goldbloom and Lance Henrickson), and I also feel that Sean Patrick Flanery put on an awesome performance. This movie resonates with anyone who was the underdog in school, as I, and many were when they were young. The story is touching, emotional, and liberating. I don't think I've ever watched this once without crying. Add to that the spectactular soundtrack (which some movie-watchers often overlook), and this movie is right up there on my own "Best of All Times" list. If you haven't seen this, I only ask that you ignore the negative comments until you've had the chance to watch it yourself and make up your own mind... you might be pleasantly surprised.$
Albino teenager--psychic, telekinetic, brilliant--is found orphaned in a rural home and is brought out into the cold cruel world for the first time. Writer-director Victor Salva follows every cliché down the path to predictability; he effectively wrings emotion from tender scenes, though he lays the schoolyard bully stuff on mighty thick. Consequently, his terrific finale is nearly overshadowed by the heavy-handed treatment (with lots of nasties in the supporting line-up). Fine cast--including Sean Patrick Flanery, Mary Steenburgen, Jeff Goldblum, Lance Henriksen, Ray Wise and Susan Tyrrell--turn in solid performances. ** from ****$
I love this movie. Beautiful, amazing, heartwarming. It just goes to prove, looks are worthless. I cry several times throughout this movie every time I watch it.Wonderful movie, period! (Not to mention he's physically attractive, but thats another story all together.) But man, I wish it were real! The most odd looking people are usually the most intelligent and kind. That proves correct in most cases. I feel his sadness watching him, and the beginning is heartbreaking. The other characters in the movie, I really dislike for their treatment of him. Ignorance is bliss, but harmful. But I don't see how these other people can rate it a 5. something! I can't comprehend that, there is nothing wrong with it!$
Much was written at the time of it's release, mostly concerning the conviction of it's writer/director Victor Salva on a sexual molestation charge. All that aside "Powder" remains a extraodinary film worth a look. A young man is dicovered living in the basement of his recently deceased Grandmother. Obviously an albino he soons reveals a intellect and abilities unlike any human before him. Sean Patrick Flannery gives a great performance as the youth.Salva does a fine job of coveying his difficult entry into surroundings he's never expereinced. Others in the cast are very good as well including Mary Steenburgen as the head of the school he is sent to, Lance Henrickson as the local sherrif in a more sensitive role for him, And finally Jeff Goldblum as the science teacher who realizes what the young man is and the potential of mankind to evolve into a more humane species. I don't think many people gave this film a chance based on the bad press Salva received. It's certainly one of the best films i've seen in recent years.$
This movie is a superb example of how humans can be real cruel with other people that are different, of any sort. If this story is seen only as a fantasy movie, then it is just entertaining and touching, but I think this movie should be a kind of fable or metaphor, and if we make a little effort we can learn to be good to any living creature on this earth, just dont forget that we all die, and that life is short to waste it in hurting others.$

Leaving Las Vegas (1995)$
The strength of this film is that you like the people, despite their enabling and their weakness. This is one of the most realistic portrayals of this disease I've ever seen and while the movie made me crawl, it was more than effective. Nick Cage's character recognizes all that he is. He has come to terms with his self-destructiveness and warns people to stay out of his life. He has flags up everywhere. His counterpart makes the mistake of falling in love with him. She goes through the hell that every person who has a significant relationship with an alcoholic goes through. Her life is no bed of roses and so she embraces his love and companionship, but like the proverbial snake, he is still a snake: it is his nature. The acting here is superb-- the characters so real we have trouble watching them. They move through the "normal" world. She grows to believe that if she sticks with him, he will come around. She can't overcome the puzzle of the control that the booze has on him. To her, if she is that important to him, he will change. There's the rub. See this movie but be prepared for what it is about.$
Nicolas Cage won a Best Actor Oscar playing a screenwriter and miserable alcoholic who hopes to drink himself to death; Elisabeth Shue was Oscar-nominated as the Las Vegas prostitute who tries to be his surrogate guardian angel. "Leaving Las Vegas", an adaptation of John O'Brien's novel by writer-director Mike Figgis, is a well-produced, well-acted drama that takes a awhile to get its bearings, eventually becoming a moving human tragedy. The opening moments introducing the characters are painfully under-directed; when he has no one to ground him, Cage can be a rambling boor (even doing a little shimmy in the supermarket, he is less a character than Nicolas Cage the actor just cutting up). Shue is very moving once Figgis dispenses with her pimp, and also with his penchant for fancy directorial flourishes that don't set any particular mood. By the second hour, the pieces start falling into place and Cage gets to do some great, high-wire dramatic acting. "Leaving Las Vegas" takes time finding its niche but Figgis and his cast finally capture the material's essence. It's a rewarding journey. **1/2 from ****$
LEAVING LAS VEGAS (1995) **** Nicolas Cage, Elisabeth Shue, Julian Sands. (Cameos: Richard Lewis, Steven Weber, Carey Lowell, French Stewart, Julian Lennon, Mariska Hargitay, R. Lee Ermey, Ed Lauter, Danny Huston, Lucinda Jenney, Lou Rawls, Laurie Metcalf, Shawnee Smith, Bob Rafelson,Xander Berkley).  Uncompromisingly bleak and powerful portrayal of unconditional love between two tragic misfits.  Cage in a bravura performance, that justifiably garnered him a Best Actor Oscar, vows to give up on life and heads to Vegas to drink himself to death where he meets and falls for pretty victimized hooker Shue (the performance of her career, and Best Actress nominee) who decides to love him for what he is.  Excellent rapport and believably realistic performances and excellent adaptation of John O' Brien's semi-autobiographical novel of total despair.  O' Brien committed suicide shortly after his novel was being produced into a film.  Filmed in grainy 16MM and blown up to 35MM gives it an all too natural look.  Look sharply for the film's director Mike Figgis as a goateed thug after pimp Sands.$
To call Nicolas Cage's character an alcoholic would be a disservice to alcoholics everywhere. I mean, even a raging drunk has to come up for air sometimes, but Ben Sanderson (Cage) knocked down bottles of booze with the speed of The Flash, torching the memories of his past and sliding into the darkest oblivion imaginable. There's some measure of humanity in the story when Ben discovers a Las Vegas street walker named Sera (Elizabeth Shue), who offers him her love and friendship because of an ethereal connection she makes with the down and out former screenwriter. Yet even their tender moments together and the poignant background music do little to hide the fact that these two damaged souls are derelicts from the human race, and as it turns out in Ben's case, beyond saving both spiritually and bodily. The film may be of service to demonstrate how low one can go before succumbing to the depths of despondency and despair, and that there may be hope around the corner if only one were to reach out and recognize a helping hand. But this one goes in the other direction, and serves as a reminder that relentlessly abusing one's body and spirit can only end one way.$
"Leaving Las Vegas" is an insightful, harrowing experience about the binding forces of true romance, the power of encouragement and compassion, and the tragic effects of alcoholism. The performances are absolutely astounding: Nicholas Cage delivers one of the most unforgettable, genuine, and human performances ever captured on film (a well-deserved Oscar for every reason), and Elisabeth Shue, as his soul provider and protector through the trauma of his alcoholic turmoil is sentimental, passionate, and definitely deserving of the Oscar for Best Actress in 1995, providing us with the eye of Ben Sanderson's heart and soul, as his equally troubled lover who has pledged to stay with him through tears and trials. Director Mike Figgis is intensely effective in following the many turmoils of Sanderson as he copes with terminal alcoholism, even going so far as to declaring he will "drink himself to death in Las Vegas", and the effects of his struggle upon his functions, health, and spirit, as well as the corresponding attributes of his loyal lover, Sara. I'm certain that anyone who has experienced the turmoil of alcoholism or has been deeply involved with such an abuser will gravely appreciate the realism and depth of this film to address the egregious effects of drinking constantly, and how this alcoholism tears many lives literally apart. I was horrified by Sanderson's dependence upon alcoholism as a substitute for happiness and control, and Nicholas Cage's uncanny human performance, with all of his appropriate, convincing twitches and erratic movements, enhanced the compassion and torment I felt for this character, who has literally surrendered his life to this terrible disease of alcoholism. We gasp in horror as we see Sanderson taking a shower with a bottle of gin in hand, and trembling to the refrigerator for a bottle of vodka: these are the true, tragic symptoms of alcoholism, and this film does an excellent job in addressing them. A brilliant, tragic, yet extremely essential study of the disease of alcoholism and how it can destroy every aspiration, every desire, and every state of consciousness we have within ourselves, when we are constantly craving "one more bottle of vodka" 24 hours a day, 7 days a week... Nicholas Cage delivers one of the most heartfelt and eerily convincing performances in the history of film, and this is one lamentable, subliminal look at one of the saddest and unnecessary addictions in humans: striving to either enhance, better, or in this case, destroy their lives in constantly drinking intoxicating and deadly substances. Sanderson to Sara: "You can never make me stop drinking"--- the sad, yet frighteningly real state of mind of a disparaged, hopeless, alcoholic. **** out of ****$
Great acting by Cage and Shue, but the movie itself is way too overrated in my opinion. I'd recommend to see Steve Buscemi's 'Trees Lounge' from 1996 - A much better movie about alcoholism.$

Othello (1995)$
I rented this film mainly to see Kenneth Branagh once again, but was totally surprised by the entire cast, especially Laurence Fishbourne who portrayed Othello brilliantly. The dignified, regal Fishbourne transforms Othello into a tragic figure with restraint, control and believability. It was also an added surprise to see two actors from Brahagh's Hamlet: Michael Maloney and Nicholas Farrel. And any film with Nathaniel Parker is a pleasure. Branagh brought a depth to Iago that I hadn't seen before, especially during the scene on the beach when he and Othello hug. Iago in tears? And then again at the final scene. Iago was evil, yes, but for an actor to find a few moments to make him human -that's when the audience knows something extraordinary has happened on stage or screen. See this film.$
As my Shakespeare Professor had mentioned, the part of Othello is highly challenging, which is why many don't perfect it or intend to play it. Larry Fishburne however did a magnificent job!  He provided us an astonishing portrayal of how even a noble, righteous and even intelligent man, can succumb to "the green eyed monster."  The calculatingly evil Iago was FLAWLESSLY portrayed by veteran Shakespearian actor Kenneth Branagh, who occasionally stared into the eyes of the camera itself, explaining his dark plans and expectations.$
While maintaining the location and time period of the original play, this film gives us a much clearer insight into Othello as a character and as a story than many of the supposedly more important versions. The dialogue is trimmed to what is essential, the settings are atmospheric, and the cast is great. You will never forget the story after you see this version.$
it is almost a spell. of a meet after a long time. because the performance of Laurence Fishburne is amazing. the result - scene by scene he becomes Othello in a manner who escapes from a simple role. and Kenneth Branagh - yes, he gives to Iago the right word and though and intention and gesture. because this is the best good point of film - to recreate a world in each of its details. maybe, it is not the best Othello version. but it is one of the most honest. and realistic. you feel the Moor. each of his states. each traits of his jealousy and fury and doubts. maybe, it is the memorable role of Laurence Fishburne career.$
Othello in fast forward ! No softer moments, no time to savor the dialouge and very little real emotion. Branagh is in fine form and lifts the production beyond the mediocre. Fishburne is a good actor but illicits no sympathy for his Othello and Irene Jacob is a total waste as Desdemona she did not even seem to know what she was saying!) Oliver Parker redeemed himself with IDEAL HUSBAND  but Othello is a take it or leave it adaptation.$
but could have been better. First of all, I would like to say that Laurence Fishburne's performance as Othello did not impress me. Although he is good, I think he maintains a bit too much dignity at the end of the film, making his tragedy less tragic. However, Keeth Branagh is amazing in this film. Like Glenn Close as the Marquise de Merteuil, but better, he makes Iago human, but still very sadistic. The beginning of the film is perfect. We see everything from the point of view of Iago, making us his accomplices in many ways, as he talks directly to us. Then, at the end, we lose him and Oliver Parker makes the great ending of the play way too long and we quickly get bored and annoyed at the melodrama of the last scene. Until the end, it is a great Shakespearian film. It is almost as if the same director as The Merchant of Venice (2004) made this. This is because both Parker and Redford adapt Shakespeare, not to make auteur films, like Orson Welles did, but to make them as Shakespeare would have were he alive at the time of cinema. Therefore, it would be a flawed but very good Shakespeare, but a worse auteur film.$
I was especially delighted that in this movie Othello himself was dark-skinned and Desdemona didn't have fair hair like almost always. The cast played very well, too, and I liked the script following Shakespeare's original text so faithfully. But I must say some scenes were acted too erotically for such a character as Desdemona. I have always thought she is very modest, and that's why it is not proper at all to show her in bed with Cassio - although it was happening only in Othello's imagination. At first, I was a little surprised even that a love scene between Othello and Desdemona was shown so openly. But as a whole, I liked the film and especially Desdemona crying in the dying scene.$
My college professor says that Othello may be Shakespeare's finest drama. I don't know if I agree with him yet. I bought this video version of the film. First I love Kenneth BRanagh as Iago, he was perfectly complicated and worked very well in this adaptation. SUrprisingly, he didn't direct it but played a role. Lawrence Fishburne shows that American actors can play Shakespeare just as well as British actors can do. not that there was a British vs. American issue about it. In fact, if we all work together then Shakespeare can reach the masses which it richly deserves to do. Apart from other Shakespeare tragedies, this is dealt with the issue of race. Something that has existed since the beginning of time. The relationship between Iago and Emilia could have been better and shown the complicatedness of their union together. While Othello loves Desdemona with all his heart, he is weak for jealousy and fears losing her to a non-Moorish man like Cassio. It's quite a great scene at the end of the film but I won't reveal the ending. IT's just worth watching. I think they edited much of the lines to 2 hours but they always edit Shakespeare.$
Price's 1995 version of Shakespeare's 'Othello' keeps the viewer's interest while staying true to the story. Although shortened and slightly modified, the action never stops, so that even restless audiences will enjoy and appreciate the genius that is Shakespeare. Desdemona is played to near perfection, and the actress portraying Emilia really appears to understand the different shades of such a deep character. When my acting 11/12 class viewed the film, we were so involved that one girl actually screamed at the screen. It was an enjoyable, tragic, comedic two hours that I would definitely watch again.$
It wasn't actually my choice to watch this film based on the story by William Shakespeare, it was part of a study in Secondary School. It wasn't directed by him, but I really like Kenneth Branagh in this film. Basically in the old days of England, black people weren't liked that much and were mostly slaves, and Othello (The Matrix's Laurence Fishburne) was a black man who tried to possibly become hero or king, whichever, of Denmark. At the same time, with his villainous lying skills, the nasty bastard servant Iago (the very well cast Branagh) tried to become king himself, and get people against each other. There are some good bloody moments, and good acting, I suppose I would want to see this again for my own purposes. Worth watching!$

Now and Then (1995)$
"Now and Then" is very simular to "Stand by Me". Thats why I saw it. It is a girlie film but I did enjoy it and even own a copy! It's only flaw- it's cliched (but hey, I'm a horror fan, so I really shouldn't complain!). Four friends all aged 12, an over- weight kid that gets picked on. The four friends have to cope with loss, death and of course.... adolescence. All these things were brought up in "Stand by Me". Despite "Now and Then"'s flaws, it is, in general, a great coming of age flick. Well acted and has a great cast of young and adult actors. The comedy is better in this film than it is in Reiner's 1986 hit. And seeing as this is a comedy, it delivers. A fun filled ride into adolescence!$
Now and Then is a good film that has a likeable cast and is funny and expresses friendship. Yes, it is definetley a girl's movie, but even though, I enjoyed it. The movie is like Stand By Me, except it shows girls's perspectives. The film is a good and fun movie to watch for fun. I give Now and Then a 9 out of 10.  :)$
My daughters (ages 10 and 12) and I love this film, we cherish this film. We laughed, giggled, cried, hugged, and bonded.  I highly advise this film to all mothers and daughters.  Some warnings.  There is a brief scene where some skinning dipping boys are chasing the girls who have stolen their clothes.  It begins with a very quick shot of an older boy's penis as he flips into a pond (I didn't see at first, but my daughters did after repeated viewings and use of the pause button), followed by a discussion of male erections by the four girls.  The scene is so well written and handled that parents could actually use it to break the ice in the discussion of sex with their children.  I did.  The girls then proceed to steal the boy's clothes and are chased on their bicycles by the four boys who are seen nude from the rear.  This scene is played so innocently and cute that a parent need not worry about it, though I have noticed my girls rewinding that scene.  A parent should not worry about their children viewing this film, however, the parent should watch it with their children.$
Now and Then used to be my favorite movie when I was younger and it still remains one of my favorites. It's about four friends that have made a pact when they were younger that if one of them ever needed each other they would be there. Now that time has come. Chrissy( Rita Wilson) is about to deliver a child and she wants her friends to be there. Roberta( Rosie O'Donnell), Teeny( Melanie Griffith) and Samantha(Demi Moore) have all arrived and are about to reunite again. While all this is happening, Samantha is telling the story of their childhood and how their friendship began. In the younger days, samantha is played by Gaby Hoffmann, Roberta by Christina Ricci, Teeny by Thora Birch and Chrissy is being played by Ashleigh Aston Moore. This movie is absolutely wonderful, it puts me in such a great mood. The story is just so great, i could watch the movie all over again.It makes you think that real friends do exist. I would give Now And Then 10/10$
NOW AND THEN, in my opinion, is a very hilarious and touching movie about the power of friendship. If you ask me, it makes you and your friends stop and evaluate your friendship. I know it certainly made me stop and evaluate my friendship with my really close friends. All in all, this was a very good movie. In conclusion, if you enjoy buddy movies, and you haven't seen this very hilarious and touching movie about the power of friendship, I highly recommend it! You're in for a real treat and lots of laughs, so go to the video store, rent it or buy it, kick back with a friend, and watch it. If you miss it, I guarantee you you'll regret it.$
This was a great family flick. It was funny and charming. I watched this film with my girlfriend, when she picked it out at Blockbuster I cringed at the fact of having to watch it, but you know, I admit, I enjoyed this film a lot more than I though I was going to. It was cute, the plot was good, it actually kind of reminded me of another fantastic film called "Stand By Me", but in a girl's perspective of course. If you have young children, heck, if you don't have young children, give this one a shot. This is a film I think any Female would probably enjoy. If your a dude, put away all your manly inhibitions for about an hour and a half, don't expect too much going into the film, and I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.$
Missed viewing this film in 1995 and was able to enjoy viewing all the great actors in the film and the wonderful portrayal of young girls growing into a very warm and loving relationship. Rosie O'Donnell, (Dr. Roberta Martin), played an excellent role as a young girl who had a very bad habit from childhood of eating food all day long, non-spot. Melanie Griffith, (Tina,'Teeny' Tercell) was a very charming gal who desired to become a great sexy movie star and arrived at the gals reunion with a stretch limo and driver. Demi Moore,(Samantha Albertson), played a very troubled young gal, who seemed to be lacking in love and the full meaning of life. This film showed very clearly how young gals confront young boys and in one scene in the old swimming hole of Summer, the gals stole the boys underwear and left them stark naked, except for a few towels the young boys were able to cover up with. Enjoy!$
This is a cult classic girl movie and i still watch it today. Although I did not enjoy the 'Now' version of the film, where the four girls are grown up and re-uniting, mostly because i feel the characters dont really like eachother anymore, i loved watching the 'then' part with the four girls growing up in 1970's USA. The excellent soundtrack just adds to the uplifting feeling of this film. Watch as we follow Christina Richie and friends growing up through fun times (Devon Sawa getting his clothes stolen) and bad times (Richie finding out how her mum died). Look for an early performance from Brendan Frasier as a soldier back from war, and Thora Birch before she got all serious! Excellent film.$
This is a nice example of a fairly popular genre, the nostalgic growing-up, adventure on the edge of maturity, friendship bonding thing. As already mentioned, the adults are irrelevant and add nothing to the film (not even acting talent). The roles the girls take are all nicely stereo-typical, the princess, the prude, the tom-boy, the 'normal' one - they could have been the Spice Girls! Anyways, if you want to see a cutsie flick that's nostalgic and fairly innoffensive, this could be for you.$
I watched this movie when I was 11. Like all movies you watch when you are 11, it has that nostalgia value that no critic can touch. Sure, it's not entirely realistic or in any way makes you contemplate your life on a deeper level. It's one of those movies you just accept, flaws and all, because it's catchy and fun and full of childhood nostalgia. The cheese factor is pretty low, compared to many other coming-of-age films. So yes, it may have a 19% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, but I will always have a special place in my heart for this movie. And yes, because I'm sure everyone wants to know, I SO wanted to be Roberta. Ps Since when have you had to have 10 lines of text to be considered a review? Wtf IMDb, we are in the culture of efficiency.$
I absolutely love this movie. I saw this movie for the first time about 10 years ago and since then I have seen it about 100 times. I love it. When I was little my friends and I would pretend we were all the characters and have tons of fun. We used to watch it over and over. Even now it is still my favorite movie and I can just relate to it so well. I think it is the perfect movie for girls and I think every girl should see it. I think that every girl can relate to this movie. I love this movie. I had all my friends watch it and now it is their favorite movie, too. I think all of the acting is great and the plot is excellent,too.$
A must see! Christina Ricci is amazing actress! Great to see Devon Sawa again.$
I love this movie!!! It is definitely the perfect girl summer movie. The plot is simple and at the same the adventure they have is so much fun. The characters are so easy to relate to, no matter what decade you belong to, you know you would want to hang with your friends like this. I remember the second I finished the movie me and my cousin grabbed our bikes and began our own summer adventure. To this year we still love to go out on our bikes in the summer. Its really great for kids of today to watch this, it gets them inspired to go out and have fun outdoors instead of having their butts glued to the TV or computer. I recommend this movie to anyone who wants to put a smile on their face.$
Virtually every wannabe feminist film since Thelma and Louise has taken its cue from a male film, but instead of doing an imaginative variation like T&amp;L, has settled for out and out rip off and a simple minded "girls are better than guys" message. Bad Girls was just Young Guns in skirts and Now and Then is just girly remake of Stand By Me, which frankly doesn't deserve the humiliation of being mentioned in the same review. Demi Moore and co. reminisce at their friend's baby wake 20 years later about the summer where they tried to solve the death of a boy in their town, which is acted out by the likes of Christina Ricci and Thora Birch. However that is merely a feeble plot device, because what mostly happens is that the girls giggle about sex, talk about puberty, take revenge on boys, sing on their bicycles and share each other's troubles. How fascinating. What little plot does go on is boring, predicable (almost perfunctory) and sickly sentimental pap. Stand By Me was a great rites of passage drama with great, believable characters, a driving plot, a touching script and performance to match, all handled superbly by director Rob Reiner. Now and Then is simply a shameless waste of a talented set of young stars to satisfy the whims of the older stars. Especially Moore, (who also produced) and is further proof of her habit of wasting good talent for her own purposes: see also The Scarlet Letter. The only noteworthy thing in the entire the film is how anyone could have thought that the elf-like Ricci could have grown up to become Rosie O'Donnell!$

Persuasion (1995)$
Simply perfect! From the cast to the production design and direction, this bbc film is the best and most definitive version of Jane Austen's last and (for me) best novel. Anne Eliot as played by Amanda Root starts out as tired and pale when we first meet her, as her previously rejected suitor Captain Wentworth returns. Ciaran Hinds is probably a little old, but the perfection of Fiona Shaw, Corin Redgrave, Sophie Thompson and pretty much everyone else raises this film. Shout out to that gorgeous opera song too. A masterpiece!$
The recently released DVD provides a wonderful opportunity to revisit this exquisitely done Austen.  Her usual themes of elligible young women and men, their social positions, and their incomes, are very much in evidence; however here there is something a bit quieter and more deeply felt, as two special people get a second chance at happiness.  The direction is remarkably fine-tuned, and the production makes a welcome attempt to portray a more realistic glimpse of the life of various classes during the period than is usual.  The flamboyant period costumes are particularly amusing, and the sight of the naval men striding along jettys in uniform with their very striking hats is one that has always stuck in my mind.$
This has got to be the most watchable Jane Austen adaptation since the recent influx. Amanda Root and Ciaran Hinds are simply the best at conveying unrequited love. One is not blindsided by the big names and distracting beauty of those that have filled the roles of more recent Austen films, and that's how it should be. The performances by Sophie Thompson (Emma's sister), Phoebe Nicholls (remember "Brideshead Revisited"?), and Corin Redgrave is enough to make this movie recommendable, but the 2 main characters are absolutely superb and sympathetic without being sappy or gratuitous. The other supporting cast is phenomenal; what one expects from a nice little English film. Cinematography and soundtrack are fitting as well. Highly recommended!$
Everything about this movie is perfection. Watch it and you'll agree.$
I've always loved Persuasion. Anne Eliot is the most mature and wise of Austen's heroines, in my opinion, and Amanda Root is excellent as this conflicted and genuinely good person. All the supporting actors are wonderful, and very true to the original source. I highly recommend it!$
This is Jane Austen's most adult work, and therefore most subtle. The movie adaptation is faithful to her story, taking it's time to develop the characters, and it is beautifully acted and staged. The strange changes to the Mr. Eliot story from book to screen make no sense whatsoever but are hardly a detriment to the story as a whole. This is one of my favorite Austen books and Austen adaptation. The casting is perfect; particularly fine are Ciaran Hinds as Wentworth, Amanda Root as Ann, Sophie Thompson as Mary and Corin Redgrave as Sir Eliot, but truly, the entire cast is flawless. I consider this a must-see movie for anyone who loves Jane Austen, or intelligent screenplays.$
This movie really clicked for me.  Felt like falling into a great novel that you can't put down.  Well organized so you could follow all the characters, the dialog and the subtle nuances of the time.$
I found this to be an excellent adaptation of Jane Austen's powerful novel. The direction was 'spot on' in interpretation of 19th century England and I found the scenery and props to be very realistic and not at all polished or gilded. The cinematography was very personal with lots of close ups and movement with character, although I did find that the lighting at times was quite dark - not enough candle light used; creating very realistic, but somewhat difficult to see, scenes at times. Amanda Root's portrayal of Anne Elliot was divine. She managed to portray the heroine exactly as I pictured her from reading the novel itself. Her understanding of the complexities of the character and how her past choices in life had created such a sad and lonely figure were very believable. She began the movie in a trance, doing her families bidding like the amiable servant they made her out to be, while in the end she comes into her own and is able to resist any further persuasion by her 'friend' Lady Russell. Ciaran Hinds was superb as Captain Wentworth, and to date I think this is his best role played. He is distant and yet subtly caring and put enough aloofness in his manner toward Anne that at times his callousness was almost uncomfortable to watch. This adaptation of Austen is definitely one of the best produced anywhere.$
The essence of the novel is condensed but not compromised. The faces chosen to portray the characters are disarmingly human. The connections between the characters are focused and believable. The interiors that the characters live in and the clothes they wear seem lived in and commonplace rather than a production designer's fantasy. The same can be said for the telling of the story. It is still about romantic love but it has an edge of the battlefield about it. The soulfulness that lies under the surface in Austen's novels is brought to the forefront. In it's own way, this is a very radical film... radical in its simplicity and in the care taken to make Austen's world come alive on it's own terms.$
It is annoying to read the comment describing this movie as Victorian since Austen died before Queen Victoria was born. It is remarkable that all her novels describe rural English life almost untouched by the violence of the Napoleonic Wars raging on the continent during her lifetime. This one at least alludes to the careers of British naval officers. It also calls attention to the "great age for poetry" in which the characters lived. This is one of a small handful of truly beautiful love stories on film which end happily; An Affair to Remember and A Room With a View are two others in my canon. Every actor/actress in this movie should have been nominated for an Oscar, a perfect ensemble cast, typical of the best subtle British cinematic style.$
After reading the book - an excellent book which only lasts two days in your hands - and re-watching the movie, I've realized how extremely good it is. It not only takes all the atmosphere of the novel: it adds some pieces, some characters, moves phrases from one character to another to add more layers, and fills the story gaps with simple details. This way the Crofts seem even most adorable than in the book, Mary is even softened - Persuasion is, without a doubt, the Jane Austen story where she's more bitter about the society, manners and such - and Anne becomes a lively character, one woman you really care about and you learn to fall in love with. Persuasion is not just another chick movie about love and people with flamboyant words and clothes: it's a multi-character story, one piece of cinema that takes care of every fictional people that wanders in every shot, one film that makes you feel happy or makes you cry without using easy tricks, one film that manages to be aesthetically beautiful without being cheesy, and one script that takes everything from the book and manages to make the story richer with wise additions. It's incredible, and not only, I insist, a BBC adaptation of a classic book: it's the best piece of cinema Roger Mitchell has ever made, a delight of passions pitifully hidden and wonderfully shown. Masterpiece.$

"City of Lost Children$
"The City of Lost Children" is unquestionably one of the most imaginative and exceptional films of the entire 90's decade and it pretty much represents an entire sub genre all by itself! It's a dark and often disturbing fairy-tale, but nevertheless magical and child-friendly. Since this is a film by Marc Caro &amp; Jean-Pierre Jeunet, you simply know to expect a unique and surreal story (remember "Delicatessen"?) filled with extravagant characters and bizarre dreamscapes! It's enchanting to observe and quite challenging to follow, as there's always some ingenious gimmick to distract your attention from the main plot. I got hooked on it right from the GENIUS opening sequence in which a child's dream about Santa Claus slowly turns into an eerie nightmare. The action then cuts to the "main" character; the evil Krank who's unable to dream himself and hence kidnaps orphans in order to steal their dreams. Krank has an army of semi-human androids, one brother cloned six times, an uncanny midget-mother AND a malicious brain in a fish tank! Ron Perlman is a good guy for once! He portrays a simple-minded yet friendly strongman, assisted in the search for his abducted little brother by a witty young girl. "The City of Lost Children" is an amazingly energetic and vivid adventure and no self-respecting cinema fanatic can afford him/herself to miss it! It's funny, frightening, emotional and intelligent all at once. The decors are mesmerizing, the music is dazzling and the special effects are staggering. I can keep on mentioning good aspects, but it all comes down to one thing: watch this film!!! It's still regretfully underrated and we urgently need to change that!$
The City of Lost Children is my all time favorite movie.  It is unlike anything I've ever seen or experienced before.  It's a movie that I hold dear to my heart and will never forget.  I have to be honest though, the first time I saw this movie, I really didn't like it at all.  The story was too confusing, and the characters were extremely weird and twisted.  After watching it a second and third time, however, I understood what was going on more, and could spend more time looking at the visuals rather than the subtitles.  Speaking of visuals, this movie has it in spades.  The environment that Jean-Pierre Jeunet created is out of this world.  The city is very dark and the water looks as if there are secrets hidden within.  The mood the soundtrack sets is perfect for the scenery and the superb acting by everybody (including the kids) just adds to the greatness of this flick.  I highly recommend this movie, it's one of those movies that you will never forget watching, and the images will stay in your head for a very long time. A beautiful, beautiful, movie.  10/10$
Having previously viewed a film by directors Jeunet and Caro titled "Delicatessen", I thought I was prepared to see another one of their works. Similar to that movie, the story has a distinctively dystopian feel to it with strangely realized characters, and unless one pays attention, some of the visual weirdness may overwhelm one's focus on the story. It involves a rather mad scientist attempting to steal the dreams of young children, kidnapped and brought to his laboratory for that purpose, though their cooperation is negated when they only dream nightmares. Although I didn't have too much trouble following the story, it just felt confusing with all the surrealistic imagery the film had to offer. One of the kidnapped kids was the little brother of Ron Perlman's character, a mentally challenged circus strongman billed as Crusher Bones, though he and others referred to himself as 'One'. I'd point out some of the other strange characters in the film but to be quite honest, they were all strange and not very likeable, except for possibly the young girl named Miette (Judith Vittet) who turned out to be the nominal hero of the story with One's help. As for the deranged scientist Krank (Daniel Emilfork), someone got it correct when they described him by saying "This man's a proper nutcase".$
this movie succeeds in the most difficult artistic field: inventing a world. Most of the times, when authors try it, we stumble always on Middle-earth... But here, it's really an original place, between Brazil and Peter Pan This city looks like a foggy Montmartre at sea and the visual impact is wonderful: the cast has a jewel with the girl playing Miette: she acts like a pro while she is a kid. Maybe her friendship with this big dumb guy could be commented but this exploited kid as a thief and later dreams maker is thrilling and for sure, everything is sublimated by the wonderful sad, melancholic haunting score of Badalamenti as well as his song with Faithful! So it's a real masterwork of french imagination, worthy of Melies and sadly not praised enough in my country!$
As in Amelie and Delicatessen, Jeunet is interested in the complex connections between things, even as small as a flea. The film is not so much about a story as it is about illustrating how the characters got where they are, often with a fast- paced sequence of events like a Rube Goldberg device. Open up your eyes and mind to the world that is created here, leave behind expectations of how it should function or how the plot should advance. You will be richly rewarded. The sets and costumes are gorgeous, true enough, but the true beauty lies in the characters and their lives; the children that are too grown up, the hero who is more a child than they are, the imperfect creations of science, and the improbable leftovers of a circus freak show.$

Shanghai Triad (Yao a yao yao dao waipo qiao) (1995)$
"Shanghai Triad" tells the story of a young country boy who takes a job as a servant to a mob boss in Shanghai and becomes a passive observer to the skulduggery behind Shanghai's opium wars. In spite of the subject matter, action takes a back seat to art as the film languishes in the beauty of each scene while telling a thin and only mildly interesting story. Expect lots of beautiful cinematography and little else and you won't be disappointed.$
A country lad in brought to Shanghai to be a servant to a gangster's moll. There's not a whole lot to say about this movie, it's pretty standard stuff about evil corrupting and destroying everything it touches, et cetera. Li Gong's performance is good as always, and the sumptuous photography is a delight to behold, although the color palette appears muted on the DVD. The plot and Li's character take some interesting turns in the third act, but it's not quite enough up for the mundane build-up. Although it's not one of Zhang's best, especially from this period, it's perfectly watchable and sticks with you for a bit.$
In "Shanghai Triad", Yi-Mou Zhang trains his lens on a gangster's girlfriend and her young servant boy as the mob lurks in the background doing what mobs do. A character study which focuses on Li Gong's wonderful portrayal of a kept woman whose singing and beauty took her from peasant life to wealthy emptiness, there's little story to be found as the film moves serenely from cabaret song and dance numbers to pastoral scenic beauty. Those who appreciate the Chinese culture will enjoy this lyric and beautiful film the most. For many westerners, however, there will not enough of a story arc to make for a satisfying watch. (B)$
If you have seen Godfather and suchlike, and believe that in so doing, you have seen every gangster movie worth your time, you are wrong. That is, unless you've watched Shanghai Triad, Zhang Yimou's terrific gangster tale set in pre-communist Shanghai. Check it out! extraordinarily brilliant actress and filmmaker at a time!!$

Dangerous Minds (1995)$
One thing I've learned through th years is that use your own opinion when it comes to movies. Just because someone says it a bad movie doesn't quite mean you wont like it. Dangerous Minds is an excellent movie. I've read reviews on this movie and saying that this was just another Hollywood movie. Their wrong! I watched this movie and I was really impressed by it. For me it was truly inspirational. Michelle Pfeiffer was excellent in this movie. There are some who says that Michelle isn't  tough enough to play the character, but sorry to burst their bubble but it's called acting. You can be the weakest person on earth but if your truly a good actor then you can make anyone believe your a tough guy or girl. The music was awesome.  The cast was great. The Plot and script was exceptional. I recommend this movie to anyone. You wont be disappointed. I sure wasn't.$
When this movie was first released, I refused to line up and watch it. I thought it was another of those simplistic and "popular" - love the teacher, fight delinquency - movies. In fact I refused to be taken for granted by clever Hollywood people who, usually, produce very "sweet" and "educative" movies. Well, a couple of years later, while I was refurbishing my own movie collection I stumbled on a special LaserDisc sale and bought this one as well (just to see what all the fuzz about it was really about). First of all, I was amazed to know that it is based on a true story, just like "Lean on me" and what caught my attention was that the teacher in question didn't belong to that profession: she was a discharged and unemployed USMC officer. I expected a war between her and the pupils she would "drill". What I received in return was an education on how one can be prejudiced, in more than just one way... Having served in the Swiss Army and having been a teacher myself, I could really empathize with the Character played by Michelle Pfeiffer. My first teaching approach, unlike hers, was disastrous to say the least... The entire movie deals with LITTLE, REAL, EVERYDAY problems and not with the big issues of life and this is probably why this movie was summarily discarded as being second rate. But when we consider how children consider and perceive our world nowadays, it's exactly what they expect us, the adults, to do as well. That's to say, take our time to explain to them the everyday happenings in their little worlds. Why mom and dad went their separate ways, why do they have to cope with homework they cannot understand and so on and so forth. This movie is a teaching lesson for teachers, not a moralizing or preachy one. It shows us how it should be done, nothing more. In Drama one says "less is more", why shouldn't it apply to life? We always want to set standards and a higher example to the students we are supposed to tutor, but what about our commitment to give them what they really want: lend them an ear when they talk, a heart when they feel sorrow, and sometimes, when required, a firm authority to look up to? Many colleagues I have met have forgotten what teaching is all about. It's not a simple profession to earn your life, it's much more than this, it's a mission, a passion, a drive, a call, just like the one an actor or a director have. In this instance in my own opinion, "Dangerous Minds" has amply achieved its goals. For the detractors of this tiny movie I would suggest to take a better and closer look, they might still learn something... But please, take your time and concentrate on it. This is really not a "Popcorn" and "Beer" movie.$
I really liked this movie very much, even if its nothing new.  I think every generation should have a movie in this genre - there have been so many, going back to "Goodbye, Mr. Chips", that they must mean something to each new viewer.  This is pretty realistic, too, although some of it is a little sugarcoated, it helps to remember that it is a movie.  Pfeiffer is very good as the teacher struggling with several different things all at once.  I must also mention that I appreciate the fact that there was no obligatory love interest for Michelle's character.  I read somewhere that Andy Garcia was edited out of this movie, and as much as I like him, I was glad she didn't have a Supportive Boyfriend Who Understands.$
For anyone who's lived the life portrayed in this movie are the only one's who truly know it's essence and value. For those who call it 'questionable' apparently haven't lived life outside of a plastic bubble. Dangerous Minds is an excellent adaption in its own and holds many memories for me and for others as well. I can't imagine someone not taking to this film. and being infinitely inspired. People tend to forget where movies originate from, they mainly based on real events and real life itself and what life is really about. I'll never forget what this movie has taught me and what it won't ever let me forget. Dangerous Minds is about love, hate, fear, and strength. Dangerous Minds is about life.$
Well..for me it was very interesting to watch a movie like because it shows how a bright person can change a ''dangerous mind'' and make them active rather than rejecting them and drive them to the streets selling drugs and the likes...the ideas is this movie were very awesome and hitting on the core of the American society in the early 90's,so that it criticizes the whole daily life in an inner city as a prototype...family,relationships,fear,fights,power,those are some of the crucial themes the movie .Actually, the teacher did a good job with the collaboration and curiosity of those students,because they feel that there is something special about the new teacher which they lacked with the previous one and also because she gave them more freedom and behaved toward them as friends not students,,,:) well done teacher!!!$
I have a feeling a lot who were teenagers when this came out will be watching it today due to Coolios passing. I have tp admit out of This type of 90s type school Genre it wasnt my favourite at the time , 187 with Samuel Jackson was. However this film was iconic more at the time because of the awesome soundtrack song by Coolio Gangsters paradise. I have just rewatched it and found I loved it a lot more than I did back then, The nostalia for styling everyone has their own individual looks. Unlike the clones today. The troubled kids are likeable. Their acting is goid enough, the story is smooth to past the time and as always Michelle phieffer shines. Her emotional tears are so genuine. She reminded me of myself when im genuinely upset.. I only wish this film ended with her taking tge scumbag principals eother head off or his job.$
Even though I haven't read the book, DANGEROUS MINDS, in my opinion, is an outstanding biopic about one of the bravest teachers of all time. The performances were smashing, the soundtrack was great, and the casting was just right. I especially loved the song, "Gangsta's Paradise," by Coolio. Anyway, if you ask me, it was brave of Louanne (Michelle Pfeiffer) to get her class to learn the way she did. I would probably do the same thing if I were in her shoes. In conclusion, if you are a die-hard fan of Michelle Pfeiffer, I heartily recommend this outstanding biopic about one of the bravest teachers of all time. You're in for a real treat and a good time, so don't miss this one.$
This is one of those movies I call pseudo-cool. Teenxploitation to the max. A nice rap/hip-hop soundtrack, appealing young characters and premises familiar to every kid (school, what else). If you see the voters breakdown you will see where this film was targeted. Apart from this we have Michelle Pfeiffer, a woman who can embellish a mediocrity just by being there. She didn't even have to act (not that she cannot act, it wasn't a demanding role). It's a superficial film, but I guess there are times you'd want to watch just this.$
Michelle Pfeiffer shows how adaptable she is, by playing teacher to problem teenagers Louann Johnson. But I was most impressed by the performance of Marisela Gonzales, who plays the gorgeous Angela. An entirely unknown actress, I don't believe Marisela has had any acting work since Dangerous Minds, which is surprising, as she excelled in her role. I don't get bored of watching this film over and over again, its something a little bit different for America. The casting crew chose kids of different cultures, and gave them a chance. They weren't to be disappointed. I admit I (nearly!) cried when Emilio was killed; this film is both exciting and touching.$
Michelle Pfeiffer works very hard as an ex-Marine-turned-inner city schoolteacher who butts heads with the prim school-board over how she should teach her unruly classes; seems Michelle has been resorting to candy bar rewards and Bob Dylan poetry readings to get her students attention. Apparently heartfelt, but almost embarrassing in its mindlessness, the flick was a commercial hit, though it's tough to believe today's cynical teen audiences didn't sniff out the Hollywood fakery inherent in the script and presentation early on. Perhaps the combination of the cast, the hot soundtrack, and the happy ending helped to strike a chord with the disenfranchised. Still, it is extremely lightweight and almost completely forgettable. ** from ****$

Twelve Monkeys (a.k.a. 12 Monkeys) (1995)$
"Twelve monkeys"'s got all the elements to become Terry Gilliam's masterpiece. An outstanding screenplay, a sustained rhythm, clever sometimes ironic dialogs. Moreover, he had a good nose about the cast. "Twelve monkeys" is also the first movie where Bruce Willis stands back from the kind of character he used to play in his previous movies. Here, a jaded and hopeless character which you could nickname a prisoner took over from a fearless and invincible hero (as it was the case in "Die hard"). No matter how he tries, he's a prisoner of the time. The movie contains a very thrilling end too. It's got a real dramatic power. But this terrific movie is also a reflection about man, the dangers he dreads (notably, the ones that could cause the end of the world and here, these are virus that can create illnesses). No matter how long it will take, "twelve monkeys" will be estimated at its true value: one of the masterpieces made in the nineties.$
Terry Gilliam's stunning feature-length adaptation of Chris Marker's short film LA JETEE is full of mind-bending surprises, yet still touches your heart thanks to the superb cast.  Gilliam's flair for the phantasmagorical works with the script by David and Janet Peoples to play with your head as much as it does with poor James Cole (Willis at his most Steve McQueen-like -- better than McQueen, even!), a time-traveling convict from the future who literally doesn't know whether he's coming or going as a team of scientists keeps sending him back to the wrong eras while trying to prevent a 1995 plague that's deadly to humans but harmless to animals.  Willis, the justifiably Oscar-nominated Brad Pitt, and Madeline Stowe as a well-meaning psychiatrist give some of the best performances of their careers.  Even Paul Buckmaster's tango-style score is haunting.  This one's a don't-miss!$
I grew up on Python and have followed Terry Gilliam's subsequent directorial career for more years than I care to remember. Half his output leaves me cold, the other half dazzle me beyond belief. 'Brazil' is his movie that I would rate the highest, but I've come to think that I have unfairly underrated 'Twelve Monkeys'. I have always enjoyed it, but I've only come to realize just how good a movie it really is. Sometimes I think it is even better than 'Brazil'. It's a close pick. Unlike 'Brazil' Gilliam didn't come up with the script. He basically was initially involved as a director for hire. Thankfully the script itself (by David and Janet Peoples) is first rate. On top of that Gilliam manages to stamp his own style and approach on to the material without sliding into complete self-indulgence as he sometimes does. The budget of this movie wasn't anywhere near as large as you would imagine from the impressive results on screen. It looks superb. Gilliam coaxes  first rate performances out of Bruce Willis (quite a surprise) and Brad Pitt (not such a surprise, see also 'Johnny Suede' and 'Kalifornia'). Madeline Stowe is also very good, as is Christopher Plummer, and in a small but important role, David Morse. It's difficult to fault this movie. It is a joy to watch, and improves with each viewing. I also highly recommend Chris Marker's 'La Jetee', the short experimental film which inspired 'Twelve Monkeys'. It is also brilliant.$
It is unfortunate that all big budget films cannot be as good as 12 MONKEYS. But alas is that not what makes these once in a while films so special? Obviously director Gilliam is a rare talent, a treasure. But even for him 12 Monkeys outshines nearly everything else he's ever done. (And that says a lot. Brazil after all is another incredible film.) But this movie has two things going for it that ale it rise to the very top of the top. #1 it features a stellar cast who all equally deliver fantastic performances. This is Bruce Willis at his peak -- before he sold out and went all Die Hard, when e still cared about being taken seriously as an actor. Same with Brad Pitt. Many attribute this film as the first time Pitt showed the world that he truly was an actor and not just another pretty face. (He further proved that point in Fight Club and many others through the years -- Money Ball, Tree of Life, et al.) and then there's Madeline Stowe. Besides the stellar acting though 12 Monkeys accomplished something even more important: it gave us the opportunity for future films such as Memento and Inception. 12 Monkeys not only featured a non-linear approach to time travel, it did so erratically boldly dynamically and unapologetically so, allowing future filmmakers, like the aforementioned referenced Nolan brothers, to feel safe stepping even further out on those limbs. 12 Monkeys opened that door and so many others. This is a film you can see over and over and still see something new in it AND be moved by. A classic by all standards.$
Twelve Monkeys is a genius movie with an even more genius script. based on the film by Chris Marker and written by David Webb Peoples and Janet Peoples. the movie centers around a post apocalyptical world, a convict is sent from the future to the past to study the virus that wiped out most of humanity in hopes of stopping it. the movie stars Bruce Willis, Madeleine Stowe and Brad Pitt. all are great actors and have done a well job in terms of acting. now the whole plot itself is the reason I think this movie is so good. every specific detail in this film must be remembered and observed. there are many details to remember along the plot and things that seem weird that will be understood only later. in general the film feels like we are entering madness without knowing it is in fact a loop of madness.$
The big problem is where to begin as this movie needs your attention the forthcoming two hours and you better not miss some minutes for getting a coke as there is a danger you can't follow. But good there is also a pause-button. Bruce Willis must travel into a timemachine to find out some antivirus for a virus that made animals rule over the world in 1996. Thanks to some mistakes he first ends up in 1990, then in the First World War and how messed up it all might look like, Terry Gilliam comes up with what must be one of the most intelligent scripts ever. This ex-Monty Phyton man knows exactly how genius SF-stories has to be told like and his choice of cast couldn't have been any better, there is the lunatic Brad Pitt (his performance in the asylum is memorable) and a superb Bruce Willis who proves he is more than some Schwarzenegger-wanna be. It's a movie you can watch over and over again as the script is so weird and complicated (and yet you can follow) that every view gives you other surprises. One of my big favourites.$

Babe (1995)$
Remember the times when a parent or a grandparent would read to a child in bed, so that the child can visualize the story and comfortably sink into his/her dreamworld? Well, 'Babe' feels like such a story. It is a heartwarming tale about a Pig (called Babe by her 'Mom') and her friends at the farm. Chris Noonan executes it in such a wonderful way. The film is broken into chapters (just like in a book) and the lovable talking animals appear like very real and humanistic characters. the lip-syncing is impeccable. Also, I liked that the film doesn't completely refrain from reality as it does show that pigs are killed for meat or that puppies are given away or sold to others. It stays honest. The voice-acting is very well done. Christine Cavanaugh's childlike voice remarkably fits Babe. Miriam Margolyes, Danny Mann, Hugo Weaving and Miriam Flynn are all pleasing. James Cromwell is wonderfully restrained. The setting is a make-belief story-book farm. I found myself wondering, 'Is this an English farm?' and at the same time being confused that the people were speaking with an American accent but there's really no need to pick on that because it simply doesn't matter. Just enjoy the beautiful farm and the lovely characters. 'Babe' is one of the finest family films. Kids will surely love it. Heck, even I loved it when I saw it during my late teens...and I still love it as an adult.$
My god, a 6.7 average score and nominated for 7(SEVEN) oscars?? It has been a very long time since I've seen this movie but it's great. Very original and wonderfully done.$
Babe is such a charming and enchanting film, that even the fussiest adult can't help finding it easy to like. Babe himself, voiced by Christine Cavanaugh(Darkwing Duck and Dexter's Laboratory) is an adorable character, and one scene in particular when his mother is taken away is a genuine tearjerker. The other animals are also just as engaging, including Ferdinand, and are well voiced by the likes of Miriam Margoyles and Hugo Weaving. The human characters were very warm and likable, and James Cromwell and Magda Szubanski were both wonderful. The film looks lovely, there is a nice story and the music is just superb, with Saint Saens' Organ Symphony and Delibes' Pizzicato. And I loved the singing mice, they were really sweet and funny. All in all, a true classic. 10/10 Bethnay Cox$
I was one of the biggest detractors of this film when I initially found out it was nominated for an academy award back in 1995.  A talking pig?  You gotta be kiddin' me!  Then, months after Braveheart walked with the award, I finally saw the infamous "Babe."  Wow!  Was I ever wrong.  This movie not only deserved the nomination, but was a close, close second out of the five nominees in my book (Braveheart rightfully won, but I would have had no trouble had Babe won).  I love this film because it has a sweet lining, yet tells a deep story about resolve, goodness, and the struggles of life in a very large sense.  It makes you think, but more importantly, it makes you WANT to think about how all our lives are interconnected and what can be done by each seemingly insignificant individual to make the world a better place.  That's saying a lot, when a guy who loves stuff like True Romance digs on a piggy movie.  If you haven't seen this, buy it immediately.$
I like the bit when babe the pig went la la la. It was so cute$
Babe is one of the cutest movies already made! It's the story of a little pig, who starts living in the farm of the farmer Arthur Hoggettt and Esme Hoggett.There,he meets many new animals,like the Sheepdogs Fly and Rex,their puppies,Maa the Ewe and Ferdinand the duck,among other animals.Winning the respect of his new owner Arthur,Babe needs to prove that he is more than an ordinary pig, who was born to be human's food: he enters the competition for the sheepdogs and wins of all the pedigree-winning animals. His trick is to be polite with the other animals, different from the sheepdogs, that only achieve their tasks being rude to the ewes. Babe is a cute movie, not only for kids,but also for adults. It has a powerful message about being polite and helping others and also to never let anyone put you down, saying that you were not capable to do something.$
This is a masterful story of a little pig, who, like the one in Charlotte's Web, is one step away from the Hormel plant. The reason the movie works so well, is that we see the musings of Babe about the everyday events that take place on the farm. Each of the animals has a set of human qualities, pride, stubbornness, stupidity, you name it. The farmer is that. He doesn't see the animals in any particular way; they are farm animals. What they do in the scheme of things determines their value. When Babe shows an aptitude for rounding up sheep, he becomes of greater value. Even his name is the name that all the little pigs in his litter were called. Things develop as a result of a jealous dog who sees his role threatened. James Cromwell is wonderful as the farmer. He uses that wonderful long face to show expressions, so subtle. He is a serious man, which is probably about par for the course among farmers. But he has a joyous side he doesn't show often. There are some scenes of genuine affection toward the little pig. Maybe it's just that we are all God's creatures and entitled to a little kindness along the way. My kids loved this movie when they were small. We loved it too.$
This is a thoroughly charming movie. I perfectly remember the day when I went to the theater with my mom and two cousins to watch this film, back in early 1996. With a large targeted to the infantile audience, Babe obtain a nice effect to an older public with an intelligent screenplay, a good direction, just like the special effects and a simple language about dreams and friendship. I saw it when it first came out and here it is, sixteen (can it be?) years later and having seen probably everything that Netflix has to offer ordered it as a "what the hey." I liked it better the second time. The movie teeters on the verge of sentimentality, but pulls back in plenty of time so there is no cringing! My favorite part of the movie is when the stoic farmer, nursing Babe who is sick with the thought that the farmer just wants to eat him, sings him a song, and then does a highland dance. I don't think I've ever seen a more original declaration of interspecies love.$

Dead Man Walking (1995)$
Tim Robbins did a masterful job directing this film. I say this because he avoided convention and cliché. He also oversaw superb performances from Susan Sarandon (who won an Oscar for her role) and Sean Penn. Even more amazing, Robbins doesn't patronize. He just tells the story and lets the events play on the viewer's mind. This is so effective because it allows the viewer to form his own opinions on the death penalty, one of the most controversial subjects of our time, without being unfairly manipulated in either direction. I can't recommend this film enough, 9/10.$
What's really good about "Dead Man Walking" is that it shows Matthew Poncelet's (Sean Penn) side of the story, but it never portrays him as a hero. We understand that, and Sister Helen Prejean (Susan Sarandon) understands that. Sarandon definitely deserved her Best Actress Oscar for this movie (I can't believe that it took her so long to win one). Never preachy, the movie shows all sides of the story in looking at Poncelet's approaching execution. Among other things, this movie should dispel the notion that they don't make movies like they used to - although this one is over ten years old. A true classic in every sense of the word.$
"Dead Man Walking" deals with one nun's struggle (Susan Sarandon in her Oscar-winning part) to help a convicted death row inmate (Sean Penn in an Oscar-nominated role) come to terms with his imminent execution. Writer-director Tim Robbins does something very difficult in this film, he makes us care about the unsympathetic character that Penn plays.  Susan Sarandon and Sean Penn dominate the film in every aspect imaginable, they play a complicated chess match at times and eventually become close friends by the end of the picture.  The fact that Sarandon and Robbins are openly against the death penalty in real life just adds to this film.  Their strong opinion on the subject leads to an unforgettable motion picture that is made well and performed well by the two leads.  4.5 out of 5 stars.$
There are few films where both the performances and directing are as powerful as they are in this film.  Sean Penn is nothing less than awesome in a film that is as unflinching, intelligent, and thoughtful about the death penalty as any film could be.  Writer/director Tim Robbins shows a depth beyond any reasonable expectation, Susan Sarandon is wonderful as the strong moral center of the film, and Sean Penn's performance is one of the most specific, thought provoking and eerily realistic performances ever put on film.  In short, his performance is a masterpiece, as is this important film.$
"Dead Man Walking" is a piece of incredible filmmaking.  All the acting is top-notch and realistic, and the script examines the issue of the death penalty from both sides, paying equal homage to both.  Above all, this is a deeply moving story of redemption, of death with dignity and loss of ego. Any film that deals this courageously and maturely with such incredibly difficult subject matter deserves a rating of 10/10.  Thank you, Tim Robbins!$
I'm astonished how a filmmaker notorious for his political left-wing fervor could make such a subtle, non-sanctimonious picture. If you're for capital punishment, you'll still be for it after seeing this. If you're against capital punishment, you'll still be against it. But whatever your stance is, this movie will, at the very least, make you reflect on why you feel the way you do. There's not one false note in the film.$
One of the most powerful films about faith. Not a religious one, but a precise , honest perspective about essence of Christianity. Admirable acting - Susan Sarandon is just magnificent - a real admirable craft.$
Susan Sarandon is wonderful in Oscar-winning role as real-life Sister Helen Prejean, an opponent of the death penalty who stirred controversy for befriending a scurrilous killer on Death Row--and finding his heart in the process. Writer-director Tim Robbins, obviously an opponent of the death penalty himself, lays on the life-in-prison propaganda pretty thick and some of his touches are uncomfortable or heavy-handed (especially when killer becomes victim, crucified on the table); however, Robbins handles the actors just right, especially real-life love Sarandon, who has seldom been shown to such an incredible advantage. The snappy repartee in the early part of the picture feels a little 'Hollywood', but Robbins enjoys a good verbal battle and nearly every sequence between Sarandon and Sean Penn is the stuff of powerful human drama. Based upon Sister Prejean's book, this is thoughtful, heady cinema. *** from ****$
It may seem weird that in my one line summary that I said that Tim Robbins is amazing while the film has such great acting and feeling that I mention Robbins.  Well, Robbins has proved himself with this film as a incredible film-man, who can act, produce, and now write and direct (even though he made a satire in 1992).  He delivers a powerful (if not climatic) film with 2 performances that make this film all the worth while- Susan Sarandon and Sean Penn.  Penn (in a Oscar nomination nabbing role) plays a convicted killer of 2 people on death row and Sarandon (in a Oscar nabbing role) as the nun who is trying to redeem him before he passes on.  To some it might seem boring that there is no plot and only a story.  But to these same people they probably thought Blankman was the best film of the year.  A great director (like Robbins) can tell a story and keep (some of) a audience in control and awe.  This film does that, without revealing if it is for or against the death penalty.  One of the best films of 1995. A+$

It Takes Two (1995)$
I was prepared to hate this movie, but I didn't. In fact, I kind of liked it. This variation on the Parent Trap storyline kept me engaged and, dare I say, entertained. I even found myself laughing at some of the cheesy jokes. What has happened to me? I enjoyed an Olsen Twins movie!$
I couldn't help but compare to the parent trap (it's the exact same premise, except everyone just decides to call it 'weird' that the two girls are identical). But it really works regardless, it's a cute, fun, mindless movie. Kirstie alley really shines, she's funny and charming and had a great relationship with the kids. A fun movie!$
Such a fun film! I remember watching this film as a kid and I remember how fun and cute it was. I love Mary-Kate and Ashley and there is amazing chemistry between them and all of the adults in the film. This film is such a cute and cheesy film and I consider it a classic.$
This is a great movie to watch when you're having a bad day, especially if you watched it as a kid. Along with Passport to Paris, this was one of the Olsen twins' movies that my sisters and I watched the most, over and over and over....so many great quotable one-liners in this (for kids and adults) Plus, Kirstie Alley and Steve Guttenberg are hilarious and very lovable!$
I stumbled on this family film while channel surfing the other night. I happened to catch it right from the opening titles. The Olsen girls had me hooked from the first minutes. I couldn't stop watching this movie until the final credits rolled. Having raised two girls I was particularly tuned into the Olsen girls. I was blown away by how cute and funny and bright they were. And I thought the love story though predictable was tastefully handled and fairly intelligent. All in all a most enjoyable experience.$
It is movie for children. It is funny. Romantic. Kristie Alley and Steve Guttenberg are fit to each other. It is a good summer time movie that watch with your child.$
This has got to be one of the cutest movies i've seen. I love the way that they have one rich twin and one poor twin. the best part of the movie is when they are running through the woods screaming and the song hippie, hippie shake is playing. This is the best movie out of the olsen twins collection and i would recommend you see it giving it a 10/10.$
If you like movies like Twins, Parent Trap, Kindergarten Cop, then this movie is for you. I was worried going in because of the ratings, but I'm very glad to have watched it. Sweet charming romance, a bit silly in some parts but I guess that's just the genre.$
One of my fave movies since I was a kid, still one of my faves now! I have no idea why Parent Trap got a higher rating than this, just goes to show people have bad taste!$
This is such a great movie for kids and adults! The cast is great, including Kirstie Alley, the nice but tough cookie women who works at the adoption agency. Steve Guttenberg, the nice rich father who is engaged to Clarise Kensington (Jane Sibbett), the woman you love to hate. Ashley Olsen plays Alyssa Callaway, daughter of Roger Callaway (Steve Guttenberg) and a very polite and lovely young lady. Mary-Kate Olsen plays Amanda Lemmon an orphan that goes to the camp Roger's late wife and Alyssa's mother built years ago. She is also very close with Diane Barrows (Kirstie Alley). When the two girls meet unexpectidly they decide to switch places so tough girl Amanda can get rid of Clarise, and smart and witty Alyssa can get rid of the ButtKisses, the odd family who wants to adopt Amanda. The girls try to succeed in getting Diane and Roger together before his marraige to Clarise, and get Diane and Roger to adopt Amanda before the ButtKisses can. Philip Bosco also stars as Vincenzo, the loveable sweet butler of the Calaway's who always gives Alyssa a lot of slack and benifit of the doubt when it comes to her little silly escapades. All and all this is a great movie for everyone to enjoy. Great Cast, Great Movie, and the Olsen Twins at their best. 9-10/10!$
This movie has a very good story, while very predictable, still a good movie. Great acting in this film. Loved this movie as a kid, still enjoyed it as an adult. This is one of my wife's favorite, so I watch it far more than I like.$
I can certainly see why the critics didn't like it, but I think all the reasons they don't like it are the same things that give this movie its charm. I find it too cute not to enjoy.$
This time the Olsen twins don't play twins, they play two different girls who just happen to look alike.  I have it on tape and I really enjoyed it. It's interesting how Alyssa (Ashley) tries to get her dad fixed up with Amanda's (Mary Kate's) social worker.  But the father's children hating fiancee tries to prevent this from happening.  Highly recommended.$

Clueless (1995)$
Silky-smooth, vanilla-coated pleasure about matchmaking in modern-day high school. Far from the insufferable smugness of all those '80s teen-flicks, "Clueless" is bright--in both senses of the word--clever, funny, fanciful and yet grounded in reality (a rich one). Alicia Silverstone is adorable, but the supporting cast is affable and seemingly carefully-picked (they all get their share of funny lines, particularly Dan Hedaya superb as Silverstone's father). Seems more inspired by Jane Austen's "Emma" than based upon it, with a few mean-spirited lines but plenty of lightly innocent laugh-getters. **1/2 from ****$
A generally quite well made, enjoyably stylish and interesting matchmaking tale aimed at teen audiences, the film manages to incorporate a number of very clever parallels to Jane Austen's matchmaking novel 'Emma' while also providing a good satire on high school life. The idea is somewhat simplistic, the plot is sort of predictable, and the young performers all look too old for their teenage characters, but these are all minor vices against this strong entry for the teen flicks genre, with a surprisingly very realistic and actually almost heartfelt performance by Alica Silverstone to top it all off.$
A fun teen comedy from Amy Heckerling, the director of the woefully overrated Fast Times at Ridgemont High and the first two Look Who's Talking movies. Clueless is the best thing she's ever done, in my opinion. It put Alicia Silverstone on the map. Well, that and Aerosmith videos. Silverstone is pitch-perfect as Cher, the role of her career. It's impossible not to like her in this movie. It's also pretty much the best thing Stacey Dash and Breckin Meyer ever did. Not to mention the first big role for Paul Rudd. As most everyone knows, it's based on Jane Austen's "Emma." For a teen comedy, it's refreshingly smart. The story may not be all that but there's lots of good dialogue rather than a string of F-bombs or Stifler-like characters. One of the few memorable '90s comedies.$
I really enjoyed Clueless... I found it fun, charming and easy to like. It is loosely based on Emma, and while some of the book's issues are put across here, like social standing, the story was updated to make it appealing for teenagers, and it ticks almost all of the right boxes. A perfectly cast Alicia Silverstone positively sparkles in the title role of Cher, and she is further advantaged by a funny well-written script, a classic heart felt story, and very good performances from her co-stars, such as Brekin Meyer and Brittany Murphy. The direction by Amy Heckerling was also spirited. The film looks lovely, with very nice costumes and locations. My only two criticisms are that the film is a little long, and once or twice only when the story almost falls into predictability. Overall, a fun, engaging and well acted film, that I would definitely watch again. 8/10 Bethany Cox$
Clueless is an iconic film of the 90s. This adaptation of Emma does a good job of bringing Jane Austen's ideas into the modern world. This movie is very well cast and each of the characters hold their own. It's is highly quotable and highly entertaining.$
Iconic teen movie &lt;3 brittany murphy is amazing in that movie, and alicia silverstone is gorgeous!$
Well, after nearly 20 years of only seeing certain scenes in this movie (I was working as an usher when this came out and snuck in some movie-watching time in between shows), I finally watched the whole thing with my mom just now on Netflix disc. In short, this was quite a funny movie about teens in the '90s with many of the now-dated references and cultural fashions not too much of a deterrent of a still-enjoyable story inspired by Jane Austen's novel Emma (though I can't believe those below-the-butt styles of today was actually quite the style then as well). Alicia Silverstone is both at her prettiest and charming in the lead role of Cher, the shallow teen thinking she's all that but also good at heart. Brittany Murphy is also great as Tai, the new girl who blossoms under Cher. Too bad her life was cut short a few years ago. And director Amy Heckerling, already an expert on depicting high school situations having previously helmed another classic called Fast Times at Ridgemont High, outdoes herself here as a writer as well with the material the cast is given. So on that note, Clueless comes highly recommended.$

"Cry$
I could not believe as I read other reviewers of this movie that they thought it "irrelevant"! The struggle for equality, peace and love is NEVER irrelevant. This was a movie that by any standards is brillant and moving. James Earl Jones does a magnificent job of playing the main character with dignity and restraint. He makes you suffer with him as a result. A drama coach I once had told me, don't you cry, let them cry. He does both through his amazing minimalist acting. He doesn't waste himself on meaningless gestures &amp; histronics, he lets you see the suffering of his soul. Equally brillant is Richard Harris as the father of the son killed by Jones' son. These two men are brought together in the worst of circumstances and that is when the true character of the man is revealed. Despite all his racist comments earlier in the movie, he overcomes his own self-hate (translated to Africans) to see the bigger picture that his own son knew all along. Someone once said, you cannot hate anything in someone else, unless it reflects something you hate within yourself. Through the pain &amp; death of his son, he transcends his own sense of self-loathing. He sees with the eyes of love that people are just people, no matter what color their skin is. A movie that communicates that is never irrelevant or unimportant.$
What makes this film so good, is that it deals with the issues of Apartheid in a sensitive, and moving way. There is no overt message of hatred, but shows rather how lives both black and white are affected by division and hatred. The words of Jarvis's dead son are incredibly powerful, significant, even to this day. I grew up in Natal, and lived in Johannesburg, and experienced the evils of Apartheid. Yes, the film is in a way too soft in this regard, but this is not what the film is about. James Earl Jones's depiction of an African Cleric in this time period is amazingly accurate. I had tears in my eyes watching his performance. Harris too shines. This is a movie for today, and is as relevant now, as it was 50 years ago. Must see viewing.$
Apartheid was a grotesque social experiment aimed at perpetuating the evils of colonialism after the age of empires was past; white liberal Alan Paton one of its most celebrated literary critics. Darrell Roodt's film of perhaps his most famous book, Cry, the Beloved Country', stars Richard Harris and James Earl Jones (better known as the voice of Darth Vader, which leads to some unintentionally comic moments) and is not an awful film; but politically, it misses its targets. Aided by some slushy background music, it invests most of its black characters with a frankly ludicrous level of dignity; while oddly underplaying its depiction of the routine dehumanisation that black people suffered under white rule. In consequence, the film's only real anger appears directed not at the system but at Jones's brother, a nasty and opportunist anti-apartheid campaigner, which was surely not quite the original point. At the end of the film, an impassioned quote from Paton appears on the screen; it's a shame it seems so unconnected with what has preceded it.$
This is a wonderful movie, based on the famous book.  It features excellent camera work, which took full advantage of the beautiful scenery in the South African countryside.  It also features an exceptional score by John Barry. In addition, the performances were quite good, although I've heard some people say they thought that James Earl Jones made Rev Kumalo too "soft around the edges".  In any case, this is a quite good movie.$
As a Student taking my English proficiency exams I was obliged to read the novel by Alan Paton. As an African born every title related to this land appeals to me. The film is a good translation of the book, nevertheless I liked the book more than the film. James Earl Jones was a good choice to play Rev. Stephen Kumalo an in the whole it matched my imagery of the novel and the apartheid policy in South Africa. The center of the drama is very well transcript to the screen:The holy black man´s son who kills the mighty white man´s son,in the sinful city far away from the origins in the peacefull countryside where the black people, however already threatened by the apartheid brought from the urban centers, are still respected and free to have their ownn choices and ideals.$
Came to write this review because the recent hoopla around the Black Panther movie made me think of this. Our society truly is clueless when a superhero movie that isn't even a "movement" or even about Africa gets a vaulted review over gems like this. This movie here has depth, emotion, substance, heart and power behind it. All things that Black Panther does not have. One of my most favorite movies of all time and one of my go-to's when I talk about powerful movies.$
Since i am South African, this movie has significant meaning. while it is not many viewers' drama of choice, it does show the result of extreme contrasts. Alan Paton was heavily criticized for this novel simply because they believed the change in Jarvis was so drastic that it did not have much realism. We do however have to ask ourselves whether 'realism' was a more significant theme than 'change'. I think it is probable that the novel and movie were designed to inspire 'change' rather than document it. To those who have yet to see it i encourage you to do so. If you are able to view it from a South African perspective (who i might add are among the most patriotic on the planet) it is an excellent film.$
James Earl Jones and the late Richard Harris give stellar performances as fathers in apartheid South Africa. This film is an adaptation of the novel by writer, Alan Paton. Since I haven't read the novel, I can only go by the presentation. Jones and Harris are two of the finest actors in film. This film captures the heartache, immorality, injustice, and other depictions of South Africa in the 1940s. For two men of different races, they are brought together by tragedy. The art director and scenery is quite spectacular. The depiction of an earlier time period is well done with art direction and costumes. The film is less than two hours. The film is more character driven than action driven. It's a sad film overall about a dark history in humankind. South Africa's apartheid separated the races where the minority whites lived affluently while the blacks lived in poverty. The cast includes Charles Dutton, an American actor, as a South African preacher. Still it's Jones and Harris' film overall. Their performances are powerhouses.$
A movie that was ahead of it's time. I don't believe I need to add except, it was and still is, a brilliant movie.$
Besides the hype, This fails big time. This is more an attempt at Filming a great Novel than an actual Film. The great cast does try but their performances are just beautiful isolated pieces in the end. It is still watchable but not mandatory.$

Richard III (1995)$
I am surprised how many people seem to hate this film. I am not a Shakespeare expert,but I love history and the 1930s and 1940s are my favourite period,so I love the way the our odd Royal Family is shown in this film,we know that members of the royal family were pro fascist in the 1930s so why not update the original story. The locations and the production design are great and the acting is impressive throughout. As for the comment about the murder in bed,it seems like a good plan to me,if you were busy with a flight attendant you are not going to notice an assassin under the bed. If you have not seen this I urge you to do so,you can watch it as a war movie or as a version of the play.$
I just rented this again for the 4th time.  Maybe I should just buy myself a copy. It's among my top five movies of all time and perhaps my favorite Shakespeare adaptation.  It's stunning, brilliant, and beautiful. If you like your Shakespeare with every forsooth and thee and thou spoken by actors poncing around in doublets, you'll want to avoid it.  If you're a bit more daring, rent it.  For the unbelievably gorgeous costumes and sets.  For the modern fascist spin that gives the whole thing disturbing contemporary relevance.  But most of all for the performances--from McKellan's mesmerizing turn as Richard to Nigel Hawthorne's sweet and simple Duke of Clarence.  Even the smaller roles are perfectly cast. I enjoyed Adrian Dunbar's sadistic assassin, Domenic West's dashing Richmond, and Robert Downey Jr. as the playboy Earl Rivers.  Annette Bening, I must say, is terrible as Queen Elizabeth.  Completely unconvincing down to her wandering pseudo-aristocratic accent.  I keep imagining her betters tittering with embarrassment every time the lesser-light Bening exited the "stage."  A minor flaw, however, in a stunning movie.  Rent it.  Again and again!$

Dead Presidents (1995)$
Gripping, poignant story about a young black man growing up in the 1960s Bronx whose parents groom him to follow in the footsteps of his college grad older brother. He has his own plans however, and enlists in the Marine Corps where he survives four years of brutal warfare in Vietnam. He returns home to try and make a new life for himself, but a struggling economy and lack of formal education gradually draw him into a life of crime. An effective portrayal of black involvement in Vietnam, with good performances, powerful scenes, and shockingly graphic violence. Tate is commanding in the lead, and Tucker a real surprise as his drug-addicted pal. Not for all tastes, but well-crafted and well-made. ***$
I really enjoyed this movie. Everyone in it did an excellent job and it was very gripping. It keeps you on the edge of your seat from beginning to end. Larenz Tate, in his best role ever, plays Anthony Curtis, a young black man from late 1960's The Bronx, who is just a regular guy who hangs out with his friends played by Chris Tucker also in his best role ever as Skip, and Freddy Rodriguez as Jose. Shortly after graduation from high school, Anthony decides he doesn't want to follow his big brother's path of going to college but instead, joining the Marine Corps and fight for his country. Shortly thereafter, we are taken to Vietnam with the boys and we meet some other interesting characters, one of them a psychotic preacher, Cleon, played by Bokeem Woodbine,and the Vietnam sequences are executed very realistically and are very bloody. After a while, we are taken back to the boogie down Bronx, where Anthony upon returning to the old neighborhood after four years,realizes that things are even worse than before, and everyone, including his pre-Vietnam girlfriend, Juanita, all have taken their lives in a different direction. Anthony is now a father, and cannot find a job anywhere and realizes that his own country has turned his back on him and many young black veterans from 'Nam, including his old boys Skip and Jose. We also meet Kirby, played by Keith David, a once cold and ruthless hustler, who has now left the life because the corruption of the city has forced him to quit his old habits, and Juanita's sister Delilah, played by N'Bushe Wright, who is an activist with the Black Panthers. Pretty soon all of these characters, save Juanita, fed up with their lives and their situation, get together to plan a stickup on an armored truck that is making a pickup of old dollar bills and is taking them to a location in Washington to burn them. The stickup sequence is very well made, but of course, bloody. This movie is filled with great performances, the best coming from Larenz Tate, Bokeem Woodbine and Keith David, heart-pounding action and good dialogue. A Hughes Brothers' classic. 9.5 out of 10.$
This was a great movie, and I think it was overlooked. It is one my favorites due to the unique storytelling and action. This movie is way better than 90% of the crap that comes out today. The acting is also superb, and I think it Chris Tucker's greatest performance. Even though the story has a lot of action, it's very believable, which is hard to do in Hollywood. For those who haven't seen this movie I suggest you go and rent it now, it's a modern day classic. Sit back and be prepared to watch a great moment in filmaking. It's definitely underrated. I think if it was promoted better it might have done better, especially since most war movies do well.$
Chris Tucker is hilarious in this movie, he has great on screen charisma, and he speaks his lines very fluidly, as if he was improvising. Larenz Tate is great as well, being able to pull off the young version of his character, since he has a boyish face.  And Bokeem Woodbine reminds me of Samuel L. Jackson in this movie.  The cinematography is also great and so is the acting overall.  Like everyone says, its not so much as a heist movie, but a reflection on the hardships of the black individual, such as finding work and drug abuse; after fighting a war that wasnt really meant for them or their country.$
I was 13 when this movie came out so I didn't see it for a couple of years but once I did I LOVED it. I have watched it at least twice a year since. If you like in to deep, set it off or boys in the hood then you will absolutely love it. Only movie I watch more often is poetic justice and new jack city. If you haven't seen it then you should.$
I did not expect much from Dead Presidents when i saw it on my video shop. The cover doesn't look great and i haven't heard of this film. I enjoyed Menace to society, Boyz N the hood and juice. But After these releases there hasn't been any great Black (Hood) Crime movies. There have been so many disgraceful movies that star some rapper used to promote the movies. I gave Dead Presidents a chance, and I'm glad i did. This was a Masterpiece, directed by Hughes Brothers after Hit movie Menace 2 Society. The Hughes Brothers impress once again. Starring highly underrated actor Larenz tate in a powerful, Superb performance. Alongside Chris Tucker in a supporting role. This is a Great Action movie, with some serious situations.$
But didn't care for the "after all I did for my country" in the final scene.$
This movie starts out pretty ok, but unfortunately descends into predictable, pretentious and dead serious melodrama after the Vietnam sequences. The best parts are the bloodletting parts and a nightmare sequence. SPOILER! In the end it falls apart completely, the believability being thrown out the window. Seems to me that the preacher-character had a pretty good life, so what was his motivation for joining the heist? And subtle the dialogue is not. One can appreciate the message though, but it could have been handled less obviously and with more finesse.$
This movie jumps from one movie-cliché to another. Even a half-hearted movie buff can't avoid wincing at the amount of 'déja-vu' moments the Hughes Bros. chuck at you... There's Scorsese 'moments' galore (even DeNiro film-debut re-makes), and ideas from Lynch's "Wild at Heart" are randomly (and stupidly) used here and there. Oliver Stone is ransacked in the Vietnam sequences, as is Coppola (in sloppy "Apocalypse Now" re-creations). In fact all is told in such a heavy-handed,un-intelligent way, that the viewer is 'turned off' pretty quickly. No one likes to be treated like a moron, least of all a movie-buff... So who was this movie made for? Audiences who have never seen the seminal movies of the last 25 years? Oh! It was a surprise to see the excellent Martin Sheen in the un-billed role of a heartless war-vet judge. At least he managed to avoid being hit by a flying chair. I sat through this and wished I had avoided this graceless BOMB!$
Dead Presidents (1995) is currently available on Tubi. The storyline follows childhood friends as they wrap up high school and join the military during the Vietnam War. When they return home they find life has been turned upside down. Friends, family, girlfriends and children have all changed within their standing in the neighborhood and they have to find new ways to survive...when surviving becomes more and more challenging, the friends decide to use their skillsets learned in the war to make a living. This movie is directed by Albert &amp; Allen Hughes (Menace II Society) and stars Larenz Tate (Menace II Society), Chris Tucker (Rush Hour), Keith David (Requiem for a Dream), Freddy Rodríguez (Planet Terror) and Terrence Howard (Hustle &amp; Flow). The storyline from beginning to end is perfect. Every character's backstory, characteristics and dialogue was excellent. This film also does a great job of showing the challenges of returning from war and adapting to society. The cinematography is so clever and well done, especially for attacking multiple settings the way it did - tough urban life and impossible war scenarios. The movie is aided by one of the best soundtracks in cinematic history. The conclusion is so heart felt and dramatic. Overall this is an all time great movie that is a must see and easy 10/10.$

Restoration (1995)$
When this movie came out, the movie critics all jumped on and called it a failure. They said it was a hugely disappointing role for Robert Downey, Jr. Although, this movie was not superb, it was at least decent. That's why I never listen to critics. Downey plays an idealistic young surgeon with great promise. Chance has it that King Charles The Second discovers the young surgeon. If he promises not to sleep with the king's mistress, he will marry her and maintain an estate. Downey's Sir Robert is, of course, a man who chases after women, and when he falls in love with her, a spy (played by Hugh Grant) discovers it, reports it to the king, and Sir Robert is banished. Sir Robert finds favor again by devoting himself to treating the victims of the plague of 1660. What I liked about the movie, is that it showed that 1660 was the beginning of the transition to the modern World. Superstitions were falling, and surgeons like Sir Robert were starting to be seen as an asset. The King was even getting into science and medicine. Robert Downey, Jr. also does an excellent job. So, why all the bad reviews?$
"Restoration" is an overlooked jewel of a movie, a fascinating and atmospheric journey to another time and place. Robert Downey, Jr. is outstanding as a young physician who develops depth and compassion. The music, costumes and settings are full of rich detail. While Meg Ryan's character as an insane Irish girl was perhaps a bit overwrought, I found little to fault in the movie. I have seen it three times and enjoy it thoroughly each time. I'm sorry I missed it on the big screen. Interesting scenes portraying 17th century medical practice, the plague, the Great Fire of London. Not for the squeamish, but not overly violent either.$
Good Lord! a historical epic without a spectacular set piece till the fire of London. There was not a minute of this film I did not enjoy! Those who need chariot races to feel historically present need to know we can't all hang out with Cleopatra or Rhett. These people, in this film, came across as real through the ages! After seeing this delight,I mourn for Downey's career. Rent, NO! Buy this movie and step back into time for two hours. As historical drama, this is surpassed only by " A LION IN WINTER" and "LAWRENCE OF ARABIA". Mel Gibson should see this film before he messes with historical characters again. Please, you critics watch this with your heart; not your eye for spectacle 'NUFF SAID!$
A beautiful &amp; thoughtful movie about chance and caprice in human lives,and about how love and folly shape us. A unity of word, appearance, and action distill the reign of Charles II into the soul of a doctor who lives through a "new age" of human flowering. A movie aspiring to and attaining the qualities of a literary novel, powerfully combining the naturalistic and the symbolic, and equal to best adaptations of Jane Austen. Restoration will be certain disappointment for movie-goers who expect explosions instead of drama and grunts.$
This has to have been one of the most beautiful movies I have ever seen. I am not as up on history as some people, but I think the time - the costumes, the dress, the manners, (though not the language), was stunningly represented. The transition of Robert Downey's character was also wonderfully done - we watch him go from boyishness to maturity in a slow change throughout the film, it's not just randomly done because of one event, but of a series of events. The music was out of this world, and the last half of the movie very chilling, very sad, very emotional. Have a tissue box handy!!$
I really enjoyed this movie set in King Charles glorious days. The scenery,acting and story were all great and Meg Ryan put on a passable Irish accent.I suppose that there will always be nit pickers like myself,and although Purcells great music was played throughout the movie,he would have only been five years old when these events took place.Still,I recommend this one and if you enjoy it try and also view'England my England'which is set during the same period.$
This movie has a great deal going for it-beautiful sets and costumes, a fine cast (although Downey's performance is uneven and Neill is largely underused) and a decent story.  Problem is, the movie is too long and poorly paced.  The script isn't terribly bad, but it isn't very good either. Performances by Ian McKellan and David Thewlis are very good.  Meg Ryan and Polly Walker turn in good work in their parts as well, but they are also wasted.  This could have been better than it was, but is worth watching, particularly if you like costuming and lavish sets.  Worth a look.$
The first half follows the bawdy adventures of medical genius, Merivel, who lived it up during the Seventeenth century. The second half has him down on his luck and seeing the light as he turns to saving humanity. It's a shame that the emotional second half wasn't given the treatment and the attention wasted on the excesses of the first half.$
This movie is a awesome experience, it takes place in the most interesting time and place for new and exciting history. The hero, played by Robert Downey Jr. is fun loving and smart and charming, as a doctor and whore monger his love of life is infectious!!! Literally... his rise through the story is amazing and funny, yet we see him changing slowly and through his eyes we see the frailty and horror of the human condition in its most high and low of times. The King, played by Sam Neil is the most funloving Royal of all times, his is brilliant and funny and yet very Kingly. His love of the arts and engineering and medicine are what every one should aspire to in their reigns. The rest of the cast is very good, Meg Ryan's hair is funky, straw like, and needs conditioning, thats a joke. But she is excellent and has a great irish accent. Hope you enjoy this classic.$
Its beauty is special. because it is defined by acting and photography and locations and plot. faithful to the novel, it is a travel across the England of Charles II Stuart in admirable manner. nothing surprising. only few revelations. Sam Neil is one of more expressive. and Robert Downey - new confirmation of his art. a film about the transformation of a man. touching. but with deep roots. so, a little gem.$
Visually magnificent, with plenty of opportunities for oppressive opulence in this delicious, but ultimately convoluted epic, *Restoration* is a lovely mess. Spanning the reign of Charles II, the great fire, the plague, ad nauseum, the "restoration" refers to, not only the period, but the human condition. But that conclusion is a difficult one to arrive at, and will only be understood by those viewers who actually sit through the movie. Shot in England and Wales, and winning Academy Awards for Art Direction and Costumes, the script involves a promising young doctor, Jack Merivel (Downey), whose gifts attract the attention of the King. Entering the revered court circle, Merivel has the delights of the world at his fingertips and ultimately succumbs to debauchery. But it is a story of restoration (as well as *the* Restoration) and redemption, with certain timeless aspects that have modern consequences, but the script begins to fray throughout the second half. With the exception of an unpleasant, jarring characterization of a mentally ill woman by Meg Foster (whose forte is definitely not period pieces), the leading and supporting roles are well cast. Downey has an appeal and charm (one that survived his recent tribulations), and gives Merivel humor, irony and dedication, in addition to the human foibles he falls victim to. Neill carries off the role of King Charles II with style and assurance, as he seeks to secure the permanent services of his mistress by marrying her off the Merivel, thus keeping her near. The King has selected Merivel for his inability to be placated with one woman  Merivel's desires keep him on a constant conquest for new and different lasciviousness  but the King's one condition is that Merivel not fall in love with his own wife. Needless to say, that is exactly what occurs, and thus begins the tumultuous fall from grace. And that's just the first part of this lengthy movie. The second half deals with Merivel's quest for redemption  not from the King, but from himself and God. It involves his daughter by the Meg Ryan character, and this is where the story changes from costume drama to social commentary. It is through Merivel's personal travails, as well as those inherent in the period: disease, pestilence and ignorance, that Merivel understands that the only reason he is on earth is to care for this child that is an extension of himself. His flight to find her and prove his worthiness in overcoming the obstacles set before him is a moment that would have been served at little earlier in the film. Despite the lush cinematography, there is an overdose factor involved that, once the outcome of the movie is evident, the viewer yearns for it to hurry along and be over. That said, it also leaves lingering memories of beauty and gratification.$

Mortal Kombat (1995)$
This is how you make a MK video game into a film. The sets looked straight out of the game, the characters had proper appeal to them, and it didn't waste time on unnecessary story. The lighting and camera work looked awesome, even with some of the cheesy matte paintings and early cgi it still destroys the 2021 version. The corniness just makes this film great.$
Honestly I thought the 2021 one is pretty bad but then I played this one and it is definitely a lot worse than I remember it. I used to like this one but the execution is just bad. No back story, no explanation, no consistency, bad costumes. The characters are lacking depth and their general vibe from the game is completely absent - they are not menacing (except for Shan) and interesting enough as it was in the games. Wtf were these ridiculous fight scenes?! And what happened to Kitana's hot outfit? At least I absolutely love the bad ass theme song - reminds me of the childhood.$
I was dragged against my will to the local suburban theater to watch this tepidly dull and overtly violent film. Suffice it to say I left the theater about half way through this tedious exercise in patience. This is plainly J-U-N-K. It concerns the wildly popular video game and brings the characters to 'life' or should I say, 'to death'? The fighting scenes are horrible, and there are too many of them and they are so violent that one becomes sickened by it all. There is also excessively loud techno music to add to the disaster. I would prefer watching the old Shaw brothers Kung-Fu movies better than this banal viewing.$
I liked the game in my childhood, but the filming was very bad, more precisely it's trash.$
While some fan service is ok, some performances are fun (linden Ashby, Cary Hiroyuki tagawa) and the theme song is awesome, this is garbage. The effects are a joke, the fights are mediocre, the pg-13 rating is just one big WTF, the story is boring and generic, the jokes are not funny, and the effects (with the exception of goro) are pathetic. Terrible movie, waste of time. Just play the games and the 2021 movie.$
Mortal Kombat is a terrific game.Mortal Kombat is a crappy movie.There is no way this movie could've been any cheesier.The game is bloody,violent,and for mature gamers.The movie is watered down,badly choreographed,and full of bad special effects.The game has creative characters with cool costumes.The movie has boring,lame,goofy characters, and costumes that look like they were bought at K-Mart.The game has a neat plot and a interesting story.The movie has no plot and no story what so ever.This movie is a ridiculous excuse for an adaptation.It is as fun as watching a donkey in the middle of a poo. Overall bad direction,bad acting,bad script,bad story,bad characters,bad special effects just bad.$
I did enjoy this and the sequel as a kid, but now that I've played the ultra badass MK9 and MKX, I look back on the movies and I really think that they should've been Rated R with all the extreme gore and fatalities unleashed, I mean, seriously, how are you gonna adapt a game known for its gore and fatalities and tone it down to a PG-13 just to please younger viewers?, that's just being a sell out and a wimp. I'm really glad that the third movie koming out next year will be Rated a hardcore R with ALL the EXTREME gore and fatalities UNLEASHED, THAT is how a mortal kombat movie should be done, NOT watered down and sissified for younger viewers$
I know there`s a ready made market for films based on computer games but shouldn`t film makers also cater for people who have never played the game ? Why not make a film based on a video game with an involving storyline , and decent acting and half decent fight scenes with real martial arts stars ? , at least that way you`ll appeal to a wider market . All these things are missing from this film version of MORTAL KOMBAT . In fact it`s so bad that it doesn`t feel like a film based on a computer game but more like aa advert for a  film based on a computer game . Weird huh ?$
There's some fun nostalgia here, but honestly not much else. The CGI has aged very poorly and acting/writing is pretty poor. The fact they used the actual MK music is dope though and definitely amps up the fun factor. If you take this film for what it is, a nostalgic mid 90s video game adaptation, you can find some amount of entertainment.$
For many centuries there has been a deadly battle between different planets, different civilizations. In the first part, Lord Raiden and his team defeated the treacherous Shao Kahn from another civilization, but he violated the sacred law and invaded the Earth again.

To Die For (1995)$
This is black comedy at its finest,a wonderfully incisive film.I've seen it many times and it gets better with every viewing.This is one of Gus Van Sants best films,right up there with Drugstore Cowboy.This was the film that proved Nicole Kidman was a force to be reckoned with.Its a brutally good part,and she doesn't waste it.Giving a genuinely unhinged performance,as well as a jaw droppingly sexy one.The performances are all excellent though,Dillon plays the poor dumb schmuck who doesen't know what he's let himself in for with ease.Joaquin Phoenix is great as probably the dimmest character in movie history!Best of all is Illeana Douglas as Dillons wonderfully cynical sister."What did i first think of her?-Four letters beginning with 'c',you know......cold!" This is beautifully put together using mock docu footage,flashbacks,and straight filmaking.Clever,intelligent,and razor sharp,films like this are all to rare.Look out for director David Cronenberg,in a wickedly good cameo!$
While Gus Van Sant's mockumentary approach does not always work great with Buck Henry's expertly sharp and funny screenplay, 'To Die For' is held together by a brilliant Nicole Kidman performance. Kidman - with her divine looks and devilish smiles - owns every second of this picture that even when she isn't on screen her presence is felt. Kidman is surrounded by an outstanding supporting cast, from Matt Dillon to Joaquin Phoenix to Illeana Douglas to Casey Affleck, giving memorable performances in their own right$
This actually felt like I'm watching a classic but for some reason it's really underrated.$
With great wit, humor, and style, this movie serves all America its just desserts and, while the concoction and its ingredients may not kill us, it is to die for.$
Nicole Kidman hit an early career-high with her riveting portrayal of a self-obsessed suburban nutcase who has big dreams of finding fame and fortune, even at the expense of her husband. Icy, satirical black comedy, adapted from Nancy Maynard's book by Buck Henry, begins strongly, though Gus Van Sant directs in his usual cobbled-together manner (he uses hoary quasi-documentary devices to propel the story, and these artifices--flashbacks and direct-to-the-camera nods--grow tiresome quickly). However, Henry's screenplay is amusing, Kidman is intensely watchable, and the solid supporting cast is first-rate. **1/2 from ****$

How to Make an American Quilt (1995)$
A very moving, beautifully-crafted film. As I have not read the book, I am unable to compare the two. But the movie is enough: the acting is wonderful, although we get only snippets of each actress/actor. The message is wonderful, and the soundtrack is equally touching. I would recommend this to anyone in love, or making a decision about love. Inspiration is abundant in this film about a young woman about to get married and in the process of building a house with her fiance. As she takes the summer away from him to write a thesis and stay with her Grandmother and Great Aunt, she finds them in the middle of making a quilt for her wedding. She also finds a very attractive young man, tempting her to cheat. What follows are stories told by and about each of the women in the quilting circle. The young women discovers that love is not perfect, and that you must take advantage of what you have, and that there is beauty in the known.$
Creaking with metaphors, it is a lovely story to watch, with a knockout cast well-skilled in ensemble acting. But it plods along, documenting the making of a wedding quilt that incorporates the lives of each person who contributes to it. Finn Dodd (what a hideous name), played by Ryder, at her tentative and mysterious best, is spending the summer with her aunts, while finishing her thesis. She is also engaged to Sam (Mulroney), who seems to get needier, as Finn seems to be getting coldfeet. The quilt is a gift for Finn's wedding, and is a labor of love among a group of women whose lives are intertwined in the northern California wine country, each of them sewing a panel that expresses the theme, "Where love resides." But love resides in many different places among these women  from sisters Glady Jo and Hy, entertainingly played by Bancroft and Burstyn, who are exactly the kinds of aunts anyone would like to have in their family, to the prickly Em (Simmons), and the unconventional Constance (Nelligan). So many different stories, as interpreted in quilting panels, do not always make a pretty quilt, and much negotiating and compromise is the very nature of putting the quilt together, as it is in life. Not Ryder's best work, but Burstyn and Bancroft are delightful as the pot-smoking aunts, rockin' out to Neil Diamond's "Cherry, Cherry." Simmons is a pleasure to see  with quite a lengthy career behind her, she doesn't appear often. Samantha Mathis is always charming  it would be nice if things would really *click* for her career. Kate Nelligan is fabulous  I was never able to abide her work, presuming her to be like the kind of tight-assed, judgmental characters that she portrayed. But I unexpectedly caught her in "Frankie and Johnny" (with Al Pacino and Michelle Pfeiffer), and could not believe I was watching the woman I had scorned for so long. Now I look forward to seeing her every time she appears. In spite of many fascinating and multi-faceted characterizations, this vehicle does not serve any of these actresses well. One expects Greatness out of such an enormous and worthy cast, but the Entertain-o-meter stops short of Just Okay, and one wishes that such talent had been applied to a script that utilized their collective talent better. The concept of the story revolving around this group-effort is a fine concept, but director, Moorhouse, has to work hard to keep the story from fragmenting into oblivion. Though not weighing in as a heavyweight, the multitude of fine performances ensures that it is fine entertainment on a lazy day.$
The thing with American Quilt, which you will especially notice if you have already read the book, is that it has a lot of contents to deal with in the ranges of a feature film. But Jocelyn Moorehouse obviously wanted to pack all the magic of the small stories of the women into this film, she wanted an entire quilt, full of bits and parts. It is only when understanding this that one can fully appreciate this wonderful piece. Fynn, escaping her partner and the life (marriage) probably unfolding before her, stays with her grandmother and -aunt for the summer. The serious young eccentric, a worried, messed-up hippie girl, confronts her future, her past and her present (dealing with gorgeous Johnathon Schaech chasing her with smiles and strawberries), when she dives into the life- and love stories told to her by the women in her grandmother´s quilting circle. The rest is magic. See the torture of love, the journeys of women and the revelations of grief and new beginnings, see what they hold dear, what will always stay with them, and learn what Fynn eventually comes to terms with: That life is not about perfection, it´s about balance, about putting the small things together, just like a quilt. So, okay, mechanically, Moorhouse really doesn´t have enough time for subtlety, and some characters and developments literally just fly by without any diving in. This will lead people to saying it´s superficial, but it´s not: It´s a journey, like looking out of a car window in another country: Just peeks. Bits. Parts. Parts of a quilt the movie leaves you to put together. If you do, like I did, it´s so moving and inspiring. Warm. The music of THE one-and-only Thomas Newman, the beautiful Winona Ryder, the charismatic ladies, the land, full of secrets and peace. This is what makes it special. Fast, but special. And the final highpoint, a literal "storm" that blows everything apart yet puts everything together, is a cinematic masterpiece, proof of heartfelt, imaginative work of both the writer and the director. They´re actually dreaming an ending together - just take this lovely movie in and stop bickering about reality. If you ask me.$
Winona Ryder spends a summer with her aunts while writing her thesis and deciding whether to marry her fiancée Dermot Mulroney. She learns about life and love through her aunts and friends while they sew a huge quilt together. Good, well-done but there's too much material for one movie. There are 5 flashbacks along with the main story and they're given very short shrift. The real pleasure is seeing a bunch of pros (Ellen Burnstyn, Anne Bancroft, Winona Ryder, etc) act with a talented then-unknown cast (Jonathan Schaech, Claire Danes, Mulroney, etc etc)... everyone's good and on target. Nothing new script-wise but I was never bored. Also good to see the late Esther Rolle and Jared Leto in small bits. Worth catching, but very talky at times.$
A killer cast was assembled to bring this story to life.  I enjoyed every performer, especially Kates Capshaw and Nelligan. But the book was better.$
Filled with veterans, (Ellen Burstyn, Anne Bancroft, Jean Simmons) recognizable character actors, (Rip Torn, Holland Taylor, Esther Rolle, Alfre Woodard), hot young adult stars (Winona Ryder, Dermot Mulroney, Samantha Mathis), some up-and-comers (Jared Leto, Claire Danes, Johnathon Schaech), and a poet (Maya Angelou), How to Make an American Quilt is an inspiring movie about a young college student staying during the summer at her aunt's house with many of that aunt's friends sewing a quilt while sharing memories of their young lives that provide material for the young woman's college paper. Based on a novel, this film provides detailed flashbacks of some of those lives and less so on others but they mostly provide some impetus for the aspiring author's decisions as she makes up her mind of what future she decides on. As a result of the constant flashbacks, some of what happens may be confusing but most gets explained at the end. So on that note, I recommend How to Make an American Quilt.$
Yes I have to say. 38 years old. 6 feet tall. Very straight. And I enjoy every minute of this film. It may look like a chick flick. Well it's a movie about relationships. Still a good thing in 2022. They were already questioning a lot back in thoses days. And it's even the case right now. The cast is all wonderful. The acting. The music. I love the tone. Watch this and feel it. It's a movie that will bring your heart even more in life.$
This movie came out years ago when I was younger and I believe getting married for the first time. And I'm quite glad I didn't watch this then. And I'll tell you why, this movie will scare anyone away from getting married. This is a movie about a young woman engaged to a carpenter who is building her her dream home for when they get married because they're engaged and she is apparently a student I'm not sure exactly what her major is because it's very odd she's writing her senior thesis Arts of I guess a tactile nature from different areas. Though she doesn't seem to be an art major. She is having doubts about getting married and instead of sitting down with her fiance and talking about things and trying to work them out, she decides to run off to the home of her grandmother and great-aunt using the excuse that they are part of a quilting Circle, and she can use that in her senior thesis. But from there all hell breaks loose. She ends up hearing the stories of every woman in the quilting Circle as they are making the patchwork pieces, and every single woman has a whole closet full of skeletons! One woman's husband cheated on her but she chose to stay loyal to him, one woman had an affair when she was a young girl and decided to keep the baby and then just take off and follow a Raven That's supposedly let her to her future husband but as she was traveling there was no sign of the baby so they really didn't explain that one very well I'm guessing she dumped the baby somewhere. 1 sister as her husband laid dying of cancer cornered the other sister's husband and had an affair. It was just cheating app on cheating upon on cheating! Even Winona Ryder's character when her fiance came to visit and they had a fight and he left she was worried and called him many times and he didn't answer and then all of a sudden a female answered. His excuse was she must have dialed the wrong number. But she was so neurotic about it because she had already cheated herself at least once that we know of and probably more than once because she kept seeing the guy he was some young guy whose family own a farm in the area! Her grandmother told her not to tell her fiance. She asked her grandmother's friend, who do you marry someone you love or someone you lust? And the friend answers truthfully, your soulmate. I think I wish I'd never seen this movie, there's a lot more to it than what I've said here but I've already put in enough spoilers and I don't like to do that with movies but this movie really angered me. When you're talking to a young woman who's getting ready to get married, you don't sit her down and talk to her about cheating. You talk to her about the right way to have a marriage that lasts for decades! And that's certainly not by having affairs! I wouldn't watch this movie again if you paid me.$

Seven (a.k.a. Se7en) (1995)$
From David Fincher, Se7en is a compelling and brilliant postmodern film noir. It is grim and disturbing but it is also very intelligent and daring. What I did love about Se7en especially is that it is incredibly stylish, beautiful dark cinematography and dazzling landscapes really do add to the atmosphere. Very little of the murders are shown but we are appalled and shocked by what we hear of them, the action is tense and the climax is shattering. There is also an intelligent screenplay, a clever plot telling of a vicious serial killer who murders his victims in a gruesome way to atone for the sins(gluttony, greed, sloth, lust, pride, envy and wrath)he deems them to have committed and excellent direction. The acting is also superb, Morgan Freeman gives another brilliant performance as the disillusioned detective and Brad Pitt is great as Mills in a more meatier role than he has ever done. Gwyneth Paltrow makes a small yet significant appearance as Mill's uneasy wife, while Kevin Spacey superbly delivers equally superb dialogue as John Doe despite the fact he isn't in the film much. Overall, a brilliant film, with adept performances, direction, style and ambition. 10/10 Bethany Cox$
Rarely there has been a movie with such a good dark and chilling  atmosphere. I even see this movie more as an horror movie than as a  thriller because of that.  "Se7en" is unique in many ways. The movies mood is already set right  from the beginning on. The movie starts dark, intense, chilling and  mysterious, a mood that is present throughout the entire movie. It's  very depressing to watch and I mean that in a positive way of the  meaning of the word. The mood is set by good camera work and lighting,  or better said, the lack of it. The music from acclaimed composer  Howard Shore also adds to the chilling atmosphere.  Unlike many other movies from the same genre, the movie is slow paced  and takes it time to develop the characters without falling into some  obvious cliché's. The two main characters played by Morgan Freeman and  Brad Pitt are presented as an unlikely police-couple that are different  in many ways from each other but in a way that is also what makes them  such a great couple. Brad Pitt for once has the opportunity to play  more than just the pretty boy and he does it with success. Kevin Spacey  truly plays a bone chilling character, almost just as legendary and  chilling as Hannibal Lecter. I would very much like to see the two of  them put in the same room, just to see who would make it out alive.  Further more it was great to see R. Lee Emrey again as the police  captain.  The movie is filled with some truly gross, sickening and horrifying  scene's, this seriously ain't no kids stuff! The movie has some of the  most sickening murders I have ever seen featured in a movie. But it  aren't just only the gross scene's that are good, there are also some  scene's that are made with lot's of beauty and profession such as the  library scene.  Dark and chilling movie that you will never forget also thanks to the  ending which I will not spoil for you. A real must see.  10/10$
A stand out film dealing with a particularly unpleasant Serial Killer, "Se7en" (along with "Silence of the Lambs"), is something of a milestone in this genre. An intelligent script, and admirable actors including the excellent Morgan Freeman, Prad Pitt, Gwenth Paltrow and Kevin Spacey, with a cinema noir style, and very grisly murders representing the Seven Deadly Sins. It is the performances however that lifts this movie above the average, Morgan Freeman as the older world wise detective, Pitt almost manic as his young enthusiastic sidekick, Poltrow plays the wife with a fine degree of sensitivity, and Spacey does his usual brilliant psycho routine. There is a pivotal scene with Freeman and Paltrow in a café which shows the depth of performances here. They are believable characters in a dark disturbing world wherein it always seems to be raining. An effective thriller with tight direction and atmospheric photography.$
David Fincher's bleak, relentless, and ultimately terrifying crime thriller Seven transcends other films of the genre with incredible plotting (the sort Hitchcock might employ were he alive and making films in the 1990s) and scalding intelligence.  With only a small handful of minor flaws -- the overly familiar retiring cop/young cop pairing; the awful "I'm taking you off the case!" cliche seemingly required by the genre; one giant lapse in logic in the downward spiral toward the conclusion that cannot be revealed without ruining the script's gruesome surprise -- Seven typically keeps its viewers imprisoned in their seats with a combination of morbid fascination and abject fear.  Despite attempts by studio executives to alter Andrew Kevin Walker's ending, the filmmaking team prevailed and audiences experienced that rare treat of mainstream cinema: an uncompromising vision.$
The movie starring Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt. It talks about a serial killer who carefully selects his victims based on their sins armed with the belief of the Seven Deadly Sins that a person should avoid in order not to be punished an excellent film in every respect. Made an exceptional story. Idea was employed The Seven Sins is very distinctive and fits the genre of the movie and the crime atmosphere. The balance between the dramatic and action scenes in the movie was second to none, and the film was more acceptable and more enjoyable - the acting was also excellent. In the beginning and middle of the movie it was a bit of a movie Is conservative in terms of acting. But in the last quarter Brad Pitt gave a very beautiful acting performance. As for Morgan Freeman, as usual. Convinces you to perform without exaggeration Or trying to prove himself and always prove himself, with his calmness and expressions he follows explaining many things the end was terrible I liked how the aspect of Brad Pitt and his wife's life was linked to the main story. After the film ended, I sensed how intelligent the director was and how over the course of the events he was building Brad's character on a quiet fire to make the ending events logical, but at the same time unexpected - the film did not see any flaw in honesty Except that it was possible to shorten many scenes. The rest of the movie is very, very beautiful and worth seeing$

Pocahontas (1995)$
Why on earth is this movie rated so low? It's even rated lower than some of the DTV sequels. That shouldn't happen. It is historically inaccurate, but why should that be an issue? All I want is a visually stunning film with great music, and that's what I got. The animation is splendid. America looked so rich in colour, and the colours were so bright. The songs are sometimes the weakest element of an animation. Here it is the main reason why this movie is so memorable. "Colours of the Wind" is one of the most beautiful songs I've heard, and I've sung it before. Pocahontas's singing voice is none other than the Broadway singer, Judy Kuhn, who was absolutely terrific. When I was 12, I tried to sound like her. The incidental music is also definitely the most lyrical of the Alan Menken scores. The weakest element of the film, is actually the character development. The protagonist, voiced by Irene Bedard, is very well done, but most of the other characters are not as effective. Mel Gibson has a singing voice, but his speaking voice is too monotonous to my liking, and Ratcliffe isn't a very likable or memorable villain at all(one of Disney's blandest villains actually), despite enthusiastic voice work from David Ogden Stiers. But Meeko and Flit are great fun, and Grandmother Willow was good too. Don't say this film is racist. Some of the imagery is fantastic in the songs of war and animosity, and the film has a great love story and message. The ending was actually quite effective and poignant. In conclusion, one of the least memorable of the Disney movies, is so worth watching. 8.5/10. Bethany Cox$
We must start with the foundation statement that this is not an historical retelling of the story of early America. We don't know what went on at that time, so we are off the mark at the beginning. Can you imagine the dark times that were involved in this era, with a group of settlers trying to establish some kind of community, and a Native American presence confused and afraid what was going on. So what Disney did was turn this into a folk tale which oral traditions have been doing forever (e.g. Paul Bunyan or John Henry or, more appropriately, Davey Crockett). I mean they sing and talk to trees. The romance had to be very strained. Throw in the search for gold and the greed, and you have a classic love in the face of barriers story. Also, there are a couple of terrific songs in this film. No, it's not "The Lion King" but many very good films are not "The Godfather" either. It doesn't mean they can't stand on their own.$
What can I say... When I was a kid, I didn't like Pocahontas. In fact, I was disappointed with this movie. Because, to me, they HAD to be happy ever after! The years have passed, and I'm 19, and I felt really stupid because I didn't like this movie. Oh my god. This movie wasn't made for children, It was made for grow ups. It's language... a child would never understand the message. A child would just enjoy the animation, Meeko and the songs. When I saw that movie again, 2 years ago, I understood why they couldn't be together, I understood the message of the songs and I understood the fact that this movie is one of the most brilliants animations crated. When I saw "Colors of the wind" I cried. When I heard "Savages!" I got chills. How Disney did that? Kids, don't watch this movie. Grow-ups, GO NOW AND WATCH. This movie teaches values that this world forgot, and we need more movies like that. 10/10$
Recently I started watching this again with my 4yr old son and fell in love with it all over again! The music is outstanding (I especially love the "Colors of the Wind") and the entire movie is a visual treat! I know many have complained that the movie is a European version of an event and demeaning to American Indians, but from what I've read, Russel Means (voice of Powhatan) was happy with the final product and its portrayal of Native Americans. Whether or not it is historically accurate, it is great entertainment and I believe the overall message of peace and acceptance between peoples is timeless good advice. All in all, a great addition to the Disney catalog of movies.$
Well when I watched Pocahontas back in 1995 I was only 12 years old, and I thought it was a nice movie, a bit too serious, but all in all a good movie. But now, almost ten years later I saw it again, and wow what a surprise I got... The movie is probably the only Disney movie with a REAL love story, the sneak around and tries to hide their love, and in the incredibly sad ending, they choose life over love (or something like that), which makes the whole thing mature and realistic. And the music, that wonderful music. "Colors of the wind" (fantastic singing by musical star Judy Kuhn) is probably one of the best Disney songs of all time. The other songs are great too. The only thing the film lacks is "classic" animation, these new things like; not seeing Pocahontas nose from the front, I dunno, I can't help thinking of this film with the animators (and style) from "The beauty and the beast". The voice acting is top notch by the way! I don't care that the movie is historicly incorrect, its just a damn good Disney film, that has crawled up to the top 5 Disney classics of all time in my book.$
Though not entirely surpassing the Lion King this was some of the best music ever experienced in an animated musical. Pocahontas is the daughter of a chief who wishes to find her path in life. She feels it her duty to keep peace between her own people and the intruding British who are hoping to find gold as did the early Spanish explorers. She finds herself falling in love with one of these new visitors and uses this relationship in attempting to prevent a potential war. But can she stop the greedy settlers from their determination to find Gold, and can she convince her Father that they should try to live in peace with their new neighbors? You may be pleasantly surprised. Between the music and the animation Pocahontas is a classic Disney film that should be included in every video collection. Just don't expect to learn any hidden truths about American history. Take it for what it is.$
Well, not that the movie gets history right - the portrayals of Governor Ratcliffe, John Smith, Pocahontas and her Father are cut, pasted, and modified as needed to make a more entertaining story, and certain elements, such as Pocahontas' Algonquin suitor, are completely fabricated. Of course, this is fiction, and not much is known about Pocahontas in any case. The movie does address some evils of the colonial enterprise - though, of course, while celebrating John Smith's romance with Pocahontas, just as white settlers did. Make of all that what you will: the animation is gorgeous, with nice portraits of Mid-Atlantic tidal ecosystems, and there are song excellent songs from Alan Menken. The romance is among the most interesting and equitable for Disney princesses (more so than The Little Mermaid or Aladdin, for example), and comes to an abrupt halt when Smith has to return to London for medical treatment; never mind that the historical Pocahontas did go to London! Anyway, even if not among the best of the Princess movies, it has become a Thanksgiving-time classic for our family.$

When Night Is Falling (1995)$
Bought this film several years back.  It had played at several theatres during its first release but I never did get down to actually viewing this film.  When I finally bought the film and watched it, it definately went beyond my expectations.  Everything about the film was near perfect.  One could feel the emotions that each character was conveying on screen.  The film was beautifully shot.  The love scenes were incredibly erotic.  A near perfect film.$
This movie is really tender, touching, and warm. The 2 lead actresses were very good and had good chemistry in between them. These 2 have complete opposite personalities with different passions for lives. Yet somehow, they come across with one another and fall in love with each other. Camille fought with her own inner feelings for Petra and finally, she went for who she really loved. The ending is very sweet, the true love staying with each other. Sometimes it is difficult to figure out what you really want but what is more importantly how you embrace it despite all difficulties in life. Camille had to go thru emotional battles with her feelings for her boyfriend and the Christian school job. The circus performances scenes were great and interesting. The lovemaking scene between them is very passionate and romantic. These 2 actresses were excellent. The dialogs are interesting. The director has done an outstanding job with both directing and writing. Overall, it is a great movie to watch and keep for collection. Highly recommended.$
Bought this film a few years back.  After viewing it, I came to the conclusion that it was by far one of the most beautifully and artistically directed films i have ever seen that deals with the subject matter of a girl meets girl.  The lead actresses Pascale Bussieres and Rachael Crawford had great chemistry and were equally beautiful which made the love scenes all the more believable and erotic.  There was no contrived or cliched dialogue and you sympathized with the characters and what they were going through especially when Camille was torn between choosing Martin and Petra. This is by far one of the best Canadian productions made.$
A great romantic movie. This is not a slopped-together film for the sake of titillating the hetero male crowd with lesbian sex, nor a cheap, half-baked B-movie for the lesbian audience (I hate it when we settle for less). This is a real film by folks who know what it takes to make a movie (a romance, no less!), deliver a story, and develop its characters. Not since John Sayles' Lianna have I seen a movie of this caliber about a woman coming to terms with her sexuality. It has characters you care about, depth, and a subtle sense of humor. You'll find this movie enjoyable and refreshing, especially if you're tired of the straight movie industry's continued obsession with making gays and lesbians into murderers, psychos, weirdos and laughing stocks, and the gay subculture's portrayal of everyone as tattooed, leathered, and extreme.$
I´d like to thank P. Rozema for making such a beautiful movie. I can´t tell you how many times I´ve seen it, but it moves me every time. It´s my Nr. 1!$
I saw this in the Cinema when it first came out. I didn't know what to expect, I just saw this sensual looking movie poster and decided to go. I was not disappointed, in fact I was enthralled by the lushness of this most beautiful film. Simply put;a love story. The Protagonist, Camille is a Theologian, a Teacher of Mythology. Seemingly happy with her life pretty much mapped out. A handsome boyfriend, a tidy well kept life, a formal career within a religious school. Her world is shaken up by a chance meeting in a laundromat, with of all people a circus performer, Petra. What follows is Camille re-evaluating her life and her loves, the backdrop for her journey is the eclectic, vibrant, theatrical circus. Giving the viewer giddily beautiful scenes, from juggling orbs of light, to romantic interludes, amongst rich theater drapes. This movie took my breath away, I saw it 5 times in that cinema, then followed it to another one, when the run finished. In essence this film made it easier to come to terms with my own sexuality, because of that it will always have a special place in my heart.$
I don't usually like to watch movies more than once, but this is one I could watch over and over. So much of the film is visually stunning and incredibly atmospheric. Camille hesitantly overcoming her social conventions &amp; fears to fall in love with Petra creates scenes that are heartbreakingly tender &amp; erotic at the same time.$
Vaguely familiar; all through the movie, I could have sworn that I had seen it before on late-night HBO or Cinemax while trolling for nudity as a teenager. But looking at its release year, I'm kind of doubting it. Still, this dreamy bit of 90s erotica feels like the kind of movies I was watching on pay cable late at night, after I was sure everyone else in the house was asleep. It's a Canadian film - I can tell because of the presence of Don McKellar (also it ends with a Leonard Cohen song). Pascale Bussieres plays a professor at a Christian college in Toronto. She meets up with circus performer Rachael Crawford at a laundromat. Crawford is instantly attracted to her and makes sure they are to meet again and, upon that next meeting, makes no bones about her intentions. Bussiere is intrigued, but, as a Christian, one who is engaged to be married, no less (to Henry Czerny), she initially resists. She's never met anyone else like Crawford, though, and the intrigue and excitement soon melt her defenses. Man, this film is HOT. There really isn't much sex, but when they get to it, it's blistering. Rozema builds it up just right. While, in its essence, When Night Is Falling is basically softcore porn, it is impressively artful. The circus performances in particular are great, and Crawford's costumes are awesome. The performances are pretty good, too. The writing isn't especially strong. The climax in particular is silly and relies on a ridiculous coincidence - not to mention an especially silly plot development that plays out in short snippets during the credits. I really liked the film, though. Definitely recommended.$
This is one of the best lesbian films I've ever watched. What I love most about this film is how the love scenes are tastefully acted and filmed. In contrast, many - if not most - lesbian films leave little left to the imagination. Another stark comparison is the fact that there are no serial killers, psychotics, or otherwise deranged characters. As we all know, it's not only common but inevitably predictable that heterosexually created films depicting G &amp; L characterizations will include at least one of the aforementioned. Another aspect I find tremendously appealing is that the women involved in the depicted lesbian relationship are anyone's woman - meaning, not mannish or ostentatious at all. The script, direction, and acting are immensely above average in the lesbian film genre! All of the actors portray their characters convincingly. The circumstances in which they come together are easily conceivable in a real life scenario. The way it's filmed is appealing and displays moments of arty elements. I am of the opinion that this is a definite must own DVD.$
I loved this movie! I first saw it when it was released in a little art house movie theatre in San Diego, and wasn't exactly sure what I was getting myself into. I was surprised and moved by the experience. The direction, writing, and overall experience was enchanting. The sensuality of the picture was breathtaking and riveting! If you want a picture that makes you feel and root for the heroines of the plot this is the movie to watch. The story is written with a quiet push to realize the emotions of all involved and wanting to see what happens in the next scene. The cinematography and art direction only add to the well written story, and the acting was done with deft aptitude. The director allowed each actor to express and show the experiences of each character that only made the overall movie all that much more amazing! The emotion of discovering who you are and the ability to strike out for the unknown was done with an exacting gentleness that I have rarely seen in movies!$
This movie is the best.....I thoroughly enjoyed the movie...I have to say that this movie is indeed a work of art...I would recommend it to anyone.....Anyone who sees this movie should be as taken by it as I was....$
The women are beautiful, and tender.  One experienced, sure of herself, the other only beginning to explore life.  Two people from entirely different walks of life trying to start and keep a relationship going in a homophobic world.  The direction is sensitive and, at times, surreal.  One could almost tell it was directed by a woman because of its empathy and caring for the characters.  The metaphor of the two aerialists at the circus is perfect: two women engaged in a beautiful, artistic, but very dangerous practice. The music was chosen carefully.   I will watch this film again, if only to see Pascale Bussieres as an intelligent, sensitive, erotic woman.$

"Usual Suspects$
I don't know what the problem is. I had heard that this is an incomprehensible film. That when it ends we don't know what exactly happened. I thought that throughout the film we were in the loop, and even if we have an unreliable narrator, I suspected that from the start. Anyway, it's been a long time since I've been taken for such a joyride with such interesting characters, even if they are murderers and felons. The plot is woven so delicately and the threat is so interesting, that I was involved from the first minute. I always wondered how Kevin Spacey, a rather ordinary looking guy with a receding hairline, got to be so well known. Obviously, this is the reason. His performance is right on and he dominates the screen, even though he is a "gimp." There are so many layers in this film, but I don't think the screenwriter ever plays unfairly with it and it is quite satisfying.$
Such films like this should be enshrined in museums, simply due to the fact it destroyed the entire genre of mystery films. While this film was unique and captivating, no other mystery will ever accomplish this sort of cult status, single handedly shaping a genre. While most mysteries try to shock you too often with twists and even more twists, it turns out to be overkill. This film encompassed such ideas with flair and originality, which is probably the reason Brian Singer is sticking to sci-fi action films. Only Memento and The Game are the only recent mystery movies worthy enough to stand beside this film. Sadly, Singer has somewhat sold out by doing the X-Men movies, but I guess trying to make films like this would be too taxing. This film will always bring a smile to my face when I watch it with someone who hasn't seen this movie. A good viewing every time I watch it, the new special edition DVD is awesome.$
"The Usual Suspects" is a complicated puzzle of a movie that I bet you can't watch just once.  The film deals with five career crooks who have big plans after they are all brought together in a police lineup.  However, their mayhem is interrupted by a mysterious character named Kaiser Sose who plans to eliminate all five of the crooks after they all crossed him in various ways during their checkered pasts.  An amazing original screenplay and tight direction keep up a substantial amount of tension throughout.  Gabriel Byrne, Stephen Baldwin, Benicio Del Toro, Kevin Pollak, Pete Postlethwaite, and Chazz Palminteri all give top-notch performances.  But it is Kevin Spacey (in an Oscar-winning part) that makes "The Usual Suspects" work on all levels.  This part put him in a higher class of actors and can be compared to Robert DeNiro's star-making job in "The Godfather, Part II".  5 stars out of 5.$
Out of the mind of Christorpher McQurrie comes this incredible story of a man in search of the devil. The film is called " The Usual Suspects" and what could be more appropriate than an unusual movie about five suspects who are anything but usual. The story originates with the only survivor of what the police conclude was a murderous and explosive drug deal gone bad. His name is Roger Kint (Kevin Spacey is perfect) also known as 'Verbal.' From the mouth of this innocent storytelling, con-artist comes the fantastic tale of how he and his fellow criminals, Stephen Baldwin, is Michael McManus, Benicio Del Toro is Fred Fenster and Kevin Pollak as Todd Hockney were originally assembled and then set-up. Beginning with a mix-up by law enforcement to put several guilty men together in the same line up, the tale proceeds cross country and culminates with a powerful, but mysterious kingpin by the name of Keyser Soze. It's through his attorney, Kobayashi (Pete Postlethwaite), the men learn they are marked for death unless they undertake a dangerous assignment. The center piece of the Unusual group is their leader, a remarkable individual named Dean Keaton (Gabriel Byrne, incredible performance). What transpires in this movie from moment to moment is a lesson in sleigh of hand. What we and the police Dave Kujan, (Chazz Palminteri) are told is not what we see. Conversely, what we see is not what we have been told. In the end, this film with it's haunting theme by John Ottman, is nothing short of incredible. A superb classic in both mystery and action entertainment, by Bryan Singer. A great film indeed. ****$
The Usual Suspects only works because of its infamous twist ending. Until then, it is simply a convoluted mess that does not offer any ways to resolve its twisting and unreliable plot threads. Films with plot twists work well if they are enjoyable up until the revelation, like The Sixth Sense (1999) or The Prestige (2006). They offer enough mystery to tease a potential revelation and enough clues to figure it out. The Usual Suspects, however, revels in sheer incomprehensibility and hollowness that necessarily demands an explanation to appreciate even at a basic level. Even afterwards, the revelation clearly exists more for the audience's emotional reaction rather than making any sense within the scenario of the film. Gimmicky storytelling aside, the acting, production values and sense of suspense were all handled quite well for a low budget film.$
Usual Suspects is one of the Best Mystery Thrillers in the world. It contains one of the greatest endings ever seen in any film. When i first saw this film, i understood 85% of the film. I had to watch it again, to recap on what happened earlier. After the second time i watched it, i realised this is a Superb movie with a fabulous twist. I have now seen this film about 20 times and seems to get better every time i watch it. Kevin Spacey delivers the greatest performance in his career. Gabriel is great, Benecio delivers a great performance with humour. Stephen is quite good in his best film. Pollak was impressive, Chazz Palminteri is a Superb underrated actor. Chazz looks ultimately smart and supposingly is a intelligent investigator. But Spacey turns out to be 10 steps ahead. Superb, brilliant and any other great ways to describe this film.$
As I was watching The Usual Suspects, I found it enjoyable, but not quite at a 5 star rating. But as it progressed, I changed my mind. It's an airtight movie with so many small details and clues that create a sense of misdirection to the twist near the end, and the storytelling itself is amazing. And that twist gets twisted with more details and clues, ultimately making this the perfect crime/mystery. The comedy lands correctly when its needed. Every character is great, and the actors all sell their roles perfectly. I love this movie, and it's a major recommendation from me.$

Mighty Aphrodite (1995)$
Woody Allen gives us an unconventional friendship with a Greek tragedy (Or comedy) as its backdrop. Story is about a sports writer named Lenny (Allen) who is married to Amanda (Helena Bonham Carter) and she works in an art gallery but their marriage is on the rocks so Amanda suggests they adopt a baby but Lenny at first says no. After they adopt a boy they name Max it takes no time for Lenny to change his mind. As Max grows Lenny is very curious about who left him for adoption and he starts snooping around until he tracks down Max's real mother. Turns out his real mother is Linda Ash (Mira Sorvino) who is a hooker and sometimes porno actress and Lenny sets up dates with her (No sex) and gets to know her better. He doesn't tell her that he has adopted her son and a friendship develops between the two. Meanwhile, Amanda is having an affair with Jerry (Peter Weller) and she moves out. Lenny tries to help Linda improve her life and sets up a date between her and a local boxer named Kevin (Michael Rapaport). During the course of this film Lenny talks to members of a Greek chorus who chant out what he should and should not do and sometimes they break into song! Three of the Greek chorus members are F. Murray Abraham, David Ogden Stiers and Olympia Dukakis. This is one of Allens funniest films in years and Sorvino steals the picture. I could listen to her talk that dialogue all day long. One of the many lines that stand out is when on a date with Rapaport she tells him she dated a pinball champion, but two guys strangled him! Sorvino appears on the surface to be just another kooky hooker but as the film develops we start to really care for her character and Sorvino adds just the right amount of charm and realism without forgetting the comedic elements of her role. One of the reasons the friendship between her and Allen works so well is because Sorvino displays her own sharp and quick wit to their spirited conversations. Allen has never used four letter words in his films but he does here and it seems appropriate with Linda's background and the violent pimp that Lenny goes to visit. The cinematographer is the great Carlo DiPalma and he's shot several of Allens films as well as "Blowup". The colors are interesting in several shots and the color yellow is very prominent. The focus of the story is about Allens character tempting fate by intruding in on Linda's life and trying to change it. This is clearly one of Allens best films and Sorvino is just terrific in a career making performance.$
The writing, directing, and acting in this movie were fabulous.  The supporting cast is one of the best ever assembled, and heading this supporting cast is the breakout performance of the century.  Mira Sorvino as Linda Ash has to be one of the greatest comedic performances in the history of film.  She is charming, and sweet, and everything you would never expect a New York hooker and porn star to be.  She creates Linda Ash from lines and direction that could go either way.  She could have chosen to make this character a hardened, tough city chick.  Instead, she went a completely different route of innocence despite sexual experience and naivete in the face of New York attitude, and it won her a well-deserved Oscar.  She is also just as delightful and funny as she is touching and poignant.  See this movie, even if it is only for Sorvino's performance, ignoring the incredible and novel script, the presence of Helena Bonham Carter and other actors of her caliber, and the fact that this could rival Annie Hall for best Woody Allen film.  Great acting, great script, great comedy, wonderful movie.$
"Mighty Aphrodite" (1995), Woody Allen's hilarious yet moving and surprisingly optimistic film can be viewed as a modern retelling of the ancient tragedy "Oedipus". Like Oedipus in Sophocles's play who became obsessed with discovering identity of his real parents which led to the most horrifying results, Lenny Weinrib (Allen) wants to find the real mother of his and his wife Amanda's adopted son Max who turned to be a brilliant and incredibly gifted boy. The search brings him to Linda, a small time porn star and a hooker with whom Lenny becomes friends and tries to persuade her to change her life. Mira Sorvino as a naive dumb blonde with a high pitch voice is mighty fine and she more than deserved the Oscar for Best Supporting role. She is convincing and very sweet, and there is not a single wrong note in her acting. Once again, I am fascinated by Allen's ability to work with his actors and to bring the best in them when they perform in his movies. Allen was hilarious trying to resist Sorvino's advances in their first scene together. Not to let us forget that we are in the realm of Greek tra-medy, Allen employs the characters from Greek mythology who comment on and even participate in the events. Among then, the blind seer Tiresias who can see the developing problems in Lenny's marriage better than Lenny himself, "Miss Party Pooper", Cassandra who was cursed to always predict the truth but no one would ever believe her, and the ancient chorus whose leader (Murray Abraham) desperately tries to stop Lenny from finding the truth by begging him in the best traditions of Greek tragedy, "Lenny please don't be a schmuck!" :)$
Maybe not among his best films but is definitely among the better ones since Husbands and Wives. There are a few shortcomings here and there, the film does lose its momentum at times, there is a lack of chemistry between Allen and Helena Bonham-Carter, Bonham-Carter is a little stiff with an accent that can falter and while the Greek chorus is a great idea and are a lot of fun and at least serve a purpose sometimes it did feel like they were being overused. However, Mighty Aphrodite is a beautiful film to look at with sumptuous settings and cinematography and fitting costumes(apart from the slightly dishcloth-like ones for the Greek Chorus), not surprising as nearly all Allen's films are very well-made with some having some interesting images. The music is also very catchy while the script- very Woody Allen in style- is snappy and has a perfect balance of bawdy comedy that provides a lot of laughs and tragic drama which gives the film heart and poignancy. The story does a very good job at this also, it's fun and good-natured but it doesn't undermine the tragedy one bit. And it does fine with developing its characters who are neurotic(a deliberate choice that is often done by Allen, anyone who has seen an Allen film before should have no problem with this) but real and well-rounded. Woody Allen directs assuredly and gives a performance that shows great comic timing and is somewhat charming. He is well-matched by Mira Sorvino who has never been better and for me gave the best performance of the film, the chemistry between them was believable. The supporting cast are equally great, especially F. Murray Abraham and Jack Warden. Overall, while not among the finest from Allen Mighty Aphrodite is still a very good film and well worth the viewing. 8/10 Bethany Cox$
I couldn't remember the title of this Woody Allen comedy the morning after I watched it. It isn't terrible, it's not unfunny, it's just meager. At its core, the movie concerns Mira Sorvino as a nasal-voiced prostitute whose baby was adopted by Woody Allen and his wife, Helena Bonham Carter; curious, he tracks her down and she gets him confused with a customer. It's not enough to build a 90-minute movie on, nor is it helped by the padding (Woody's Manhattan marriage to Carter--a bad choice--and a literal Greek chorus who chime in once in a while). Sorvino won an Oscar, and indeed she really perks things up, but this is a silly role with few dimensions. Disposable Woody Allen used to be better than most other movies around, but here even the Woodman is down for the count. *1/2 from ****$
I enjoyed the film from the very first minute to the last. I knew that Paul Sorvino had a daughter but I could never imagine that she is so beautiful and mainly, so talented. Allen's direction is always very good, the cast was, as always remarkable, the scenes, music and every detail was according to Allen's standards, but this specific film was something special. I 'll keep my smile for days. Allow me a special mention to Mr. Jack Warden, and the charming Miss Helena Bonham Carter.$
"Mighty Aphrodite" is way down the list of great Woody Allen films.  In fact, by his high standards this is an utter disappointment.  However, Mira Sorvino saves this film and makes it appear better than it actually is. Allen and wife Helena Bonham Carter adopt a son and when Allen becomes curious about the biological mother he hunts down the woman (Sorvino in an unforgettable Oscar-winning turn).  Of course, Sorvino is a hooker and glorified porn star.  Allen's screenplay is humorous and insightful, but some elements of this film just do not work (the Greek Choir in particular). The direction also appears misguided and a good ensemble cast seems wasted at times.  Olympia Dukakis, F. Murray Abraham, and Peter Weller all just fill up dead time in the venture.  If Mira Sorvino's character had more screen time the whole film would have been better.  In short she is the only real reason to give "Mighty Aphrodite" any consideration.  3.5 out of 5 stars.$

Lamerica (1994)$
I just finished watching this film and it brought back to me memories of my life in Albania. the film is very precise in it's description of life in our poor land after the riots and the exoduses that occurred in the early '90s. I was lucky myself not to have gone through what most people go through during this film but I can identify with some of it. even though the film focuses more on the italian businessman, the struggle for survival that most Albanians had to go and still have to is quite clear.  this film should be watched by all interested in understanding why people have to abandon their homelands. this is a perfect example and should open eyes to many.$
This movie started slowly for me but got better and better as it progressed. It's the story of a couple sleazy Italian con men who were looking to strike it rich in post-Communist Albania. They were creating a fake company and needed a stooge to be their Albanian CEO. For this, they want someone who is completely forgotten, so they go to a hell-hole that had been a prison for political prisoners and pick out an addle-brained man who'd been incarcerated there for almost 50 years. The way this poor soul is treated is pretty pathetic, however the irony occurs when the younger crook is stranded in Albania and his car is vandalized. He THINKS everything will be fine since he is a foreigner. But, he too becomes a refugee like so many Albanians. At this point, the "crazy old man" shows he isn't quite as crazy as you'd thought and despite his incarceration, he has not lost his humanity--all this being revealed as the Italian jerk slowly loses everything he has. It's an amazing juxtaposition and this makes this strange movie so worth seeing.$
"Lamerica" takes the audience through the devastation of post-communist Albania as it follows the odyssey of a young Italian man who has come to make some easy money but finds himself caught up in the same curious mix of hopeful despair etched into the faces of people he's come to swindle. The film has little plot, the feel of a documentary, and most of the scenes are perfunctory. Nonetheless, "Lamerica" will beg a strange fascination from those who find grizzled realism interesting.$
Italian director Gianni Amelio is a true filmmaker who is absolutely committed to his art.It is this serious as well as loyal commitment to the real cause of cinema which has led him to make a unique place for himself as a filmmaker whose stories are rooted in culture and civilizations in which they take place.Whether it is Albania or China,films by director Gianni Amelio always make a lot of sense as they never neglect the local stories for reaching the global audiences.The scale on which Gianni Amelio shoots his films is grand.'Lamerica' is an enduring proof of the grandeur of his vision.In this film,he depicts the mean nature of some human beings for whom the other persons'sufferings are a source of personal aggrandizement.There is also a lot of authenticity as Lamerica is based on the real story about the collapse of Albania after the end of a very long communist rule.How an affluent culture is blindly followed by a less fortunate culture has also been vividly described in Lamerica. This is exactly an element which makes the whole story palatable to audiences' tastes.$
I thought this was an incredible film with a story that was in many ways simple, yet complex in dealing with redemption.  An Italian swindler goes to Albania to make a few quick lire, only to get swallowed up by the depth of the Albanian situation.$
Amelio stile of directing amazes me everytime more and more. A powerful movie, being very realistic and documentary. Once again, Enrico Lo Verso acting and leading the movie is great. This movie was filmed few years after the government was overthrown and I consider AMelio to be brave with this theme and from my understanding he reflected what happened in a realistic way.$
Rather abruptly - and permanently - veering from its storyline at first confused this viewer. The suggested plot seemed so pregnant with intrigue, fun, potential, etc. Then the plot shifts and the impact such has on the two main characters is, I have concluded, what makes LAMERICA a good movie. LAMERICA is about a person's comprehension of values as well as the impact of age and wisdom upon such. I concede that the film uses rather ordinary plot devises of violent setting, young vs. old, etc., to contrast the characters' predicaments. But LAMERICA's lessons are taught without moralizing or melodrama or preachy dialog. For example, a death during the film comes about in mundane fashion; i.e., entirely without tragedy, violence or emotion. It takes reflection on the entire film to recognize its importance, place, etc. The same can be said about bits of dialog and brief encounters throughout the film: Much as in real life, their importance, the lesson they impart, is only understood when stepping back to look at the big picture.$
I mistakenly thought I had finished all titles from all previous editions of the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die back when we stuck at home during lockdown in 2020. However, after double-checking my reviews and the checklist, it turns out I missed this Albanian/Italian film, so I got on with it when I got the opportunity. Basically, set in Albania after the fall of communism, a pair of racketeers arrive from Italy, young man Gino (Enrico Lo Verso) originally from Sicily and the older Fiore (Michele Placido). They create a start-up scam shoe factory, with the intention to use the fake company to embezzle investors. With the help of an Albanian middleman, they decide to look for a figurehead "chairman", someone who will do what they say with no questions. Spiro Tozaj (Carmelo Di Mazzarelli) is a political prisoner who deserted to be with his family but has lost track of time and events of the world. He is unsure of his age and was imprisoned for many years. Gino and Fiore recruit him believing he is a man with no relatives, thinking he will be the perfect candidate for business, giving hope to local Albanians. Through numerous circumstances, the old man ends up in the middle of the Albanian outback, with Gino going after him to bring him back. It is later revealed that Spiro's real name is Michele Tallaricoof, a Sicilian. Gino tries many times to stay close to the old man, who continually tries to use local public transport to find his own way, with no idea where he is going. There are distressing incidents along the way, including Gino having the tyres stolen from his car, and Michele tortured by children when he is almost asphyxiated with smoke. Slowly, Gino and Michele agree to stand by each other. They communicate more through their travels, by car and by train. Gino gets to know more about Michele and his struggles through poverty. Michele becomes wiser, giving words of wisdom to Gino and the other younger characters he meets along the way. Trouble comes Gino's way when the business falls apart and he ends up in a jail himself. Corruption eventually leads Gino losing his freedom and departing on a cargo ship, along with hundreds of other refugees and travellers, bound for America. In the end, the two men, both Catholics, are brought back together, Gino and Michele realise they need each other the most. Also starring Piro Milkani as Selimi, and Elida Janushi as Selimi's Cousin. I will be honest and say that obviously I didn't fully understand all the political elements of the story, I was just caught up by the road movie style adventure between the young man and the older former prisoner. It is a good insight into how a country caught in turmoil can cause personal problems and change people, the Albanian locations are fascinating to see, and the two lead characters are engaging through their various exploits, an interesting drama. Worth watching!$

"Big Green$
The students in a small Texan town have a new teacher from England (Olivia D'Abo). She is trying hard to motivate and communicate with her pupils, with only limited success. Limited, that is, until she gets her students excited about soccer. She assembles a ragtime team, with no uniforms, and teaches them about the fundamentals of soccer. The team, with a mixture of girls and boys, begins playing matches. They lose. The teacher enlists the help of the local sheriff (Steve Guttenberg) and, together, they help the team improve. But, will they succeed in winning soccer games? This is another stroll down Mighty Ducks lane but it is still a good film for children. It's themes of hard work and teamwork are undeniable and very worthwhile. The actors, the script, and the Texas setting form a touching and funny film. If you want to find a good family film for a night at home, try this one. Big grins will pop up over The Big Green.$
OK, the Big Green is not academy award quality. But it features a fine cast, led by Steve Guttenberg. It is set in rural Texas, and the kids on the soccer team don't have much confidence in their ability to win the big one. But a teacher transfer from England, a gorgeous woman at that, helps turn them around. The scene-stealer is Milt Oberman (who is most qualified as a stand in for Danny DeVito) as the referee in the final game, delivering a riveting, if somewhat understated, performance. This is a great feel-good movie to watch especially with your kids or grandkids. But adults should all enjoy it also.$
A great family film about soccer. I've loved this movie ever since I was a child. The plot isn't anything special and is rather predictable but the numerous comic scenes make up for it. the film not only deals with soccer but also with some more serious issues including one family's immigration problems and another child with an alcoholic father. The name The Big Green refers to the team's name which was what the field they play on used to be called. One of my favorite scenes in the movie is when the children are practicing while the parents look on, when it starts to rain the kids wont give up the ball and the coaches and parents try and get the ball. what happens is a cute moment between all of the families playing soccer in the rain and mud together. overall this film is just very cute and I highly recommend it especially for families with young kids. or even for elderly people who can no longer understand a very complicated plot, my grandmother really enjoys this movie. anyways if you haven't seen this movie you should seek it out and watch it when you get the chance.$
Even at 13 this film is still one of my favorites I borrowed it from my friend and got it for christmas one year. One day a group of misfit kids decide to go for a bike ride and feed some birds and a lady thinks their being attacked she claims that she is their teacher. These kids are playing around at the police station and are told off by sheriff Tom Palmer. Determined to motivate her students Anna forms a soccer team with the help of Tom Palmer. At the field they meet a group of bullies also a soccer team called The Knights coached by the snobbish Jay Huffer Tom's old nemesis. The Knights wind up winning by a final score of 18-0. But they soon become a winning team and defeat The Knights in the championship game 4-3. In the end Jay Has to kiss the goat. 9/10$
If you're looking for a sophisticated piece of art, "The Big Green" is not it. This is a family film for elementary school kids. I watched this movie for the first time when I was nine, and I absolutely loved it. I loved cheering for the underdog, and from my nine-year-old point of view, all the events were realistic and all the characters were believable. I especially loved Larry, who was hilarious in his delusions. I watched this film again tonight and realize that it is a clichéd film, but only because I'm much older and more cynical. However, this does not take away the fact that it brought back the days when I resolutely believed that the harder I worked, the more it would pay off and that anybody could be a winner. It is optimistic, heart-warming and uplifting for that inner nine-year-old.$
The movie is great and i love it to this day. It starts out by showing a hick town in the middle of nowhere. I can relate to this because i live in a hick town. These boys are buying Cheeto's to feed the birds. They lay down in the middle of a field and let birds eat off of them. This looks like fun, actually. A beautiful woman runs up with a water hose and scares the birds off in an attempt to save the children. They then find out she is their teacher. For some reason, there is only two classes. I guess the little kids are elementary. They tell the sheriff there is big news. Their new teacher is hot. The next morning, she tries to teach them only to find out she knows nothing about them. THe way she finally connects to them is to play soccer using a kickball. For some reason, they think a football looks like a lemon. I don't know why. They need another player to be an official team so they get this kid, Newt. he is always dragging a wagon full of junk. The fact that he has show and tell just goes to show how little he is. At their first official game, they lose badly and feel horrible. They don't even have a name. It is decided the next day to call themselves the big green after their field of all things. Anna starts them on training, which involves a lot of running. She even makes Tom join in the running, although she is the only one not exhausted after the workout. She seems to be in exceptional shape. They train but still lose until they get uniforms and all of the sudden feel like a real team. They talk to this Mexican dude's mom and get him to join. They start winning and eventually get to the final game. Their opponent turns out to be the jerk that beat them the first time. He hits on Anna and they make a deal. If he wins, she will kiss him. If they win, he has to kiss the goat, who is eating trash at that moment. It is quite funny considering the deal they just made. They lose for a while and then Tom brings the Mexican brat up there. He gets the game going again and they actually get good points and tie it in the last inning. The game goes in overtime and it get close but, in classic Disney format, they win and are all happy and proud. Come on, did you think they were gonna lose? Like Disney would let that happen. The coach has to kiss the goat and everyone laughs when he kisses her, because of course kissing a goat is the climax of all that is funny. Tom picks up Anna and gives her a big wet one. The kids pick her up and cheer. All the parents are so proud and everyone is so happy now.$
HOW MANY MOVIES ARE THERE GOING TO BE IN WHICH AGAINST ALL ODDS, A RAGTAG TEAM BEATS THE BIG GUYS WITH ALL THE MONEY?!!!!!!!! There's nothing new in "The Big Green". If anything, you want them to lose. Steve Guttenberg used to have such a good resume ("The Boys from Brazil", "Police Academy", "Cocoon"). Why, OH WHY, did he have to do these sorts of movies during the 1990s and beyond?! So, just avoid this movie. There are plenty of good movies out there, so there's no reason to waste your time and money on this junk. Obviously, the "green" on their minds was money, because there's no creativity here. At least in recent years, Disney has produced some clever movies with Pixar.$
Very cute, that exaggerated children's old man, full of bullying and politically incorrect, but with a cute message, cute children and funny scenes... In fact, very passionate, children's school drama that infects me and warms our hearts...$
Nothing more than a soccer knock-off of The Mighty Ducks, this film proved to be annoying in most aspects. This was one of those times where you're parents ask you to take your younger siblings just so they don't have to deal with them for a few hours. To say the least, my younger sisters liked it, but it proved to be too much like the far superior Mighty Ducks. Oh well, at least Olivia d'Abo was hot and Steve Guttenberg still had a job at that point in time.$
A bunch of losers all band together and join the sports team and slowly turn from disjointed misfits into a cohesive group that cares and grows together. It's remarkably unoriginal in it's plot but I give it points for having some fun characters. Also, there's this really great visual thing they do where the goalie sees the opposing offense as various monsters and warriors. It's a creative way of presenting fear and anxiety in a child friendly way.$
This movie is funny, cool and about showing a lower school , if have the ability to learn and keep trying they can do anything. Got Patrick O'Renna, and Steve Guttenburg to me this is a good movie.. Sadly most good movies are usually low and dumb movies, with no real good cast or idea get high ratings, but it deserves better. I have VHS of it but i can't wait for a DVD or so of it. 7/10$
The adults really dominated the kids ( especially seeing Olivia D'Abo in a mini skirt), Olivia plays Anna Montgomery a British woman teaching in a small town in Texas and introducing them to soccer. The problem is except for Newt ( Bug Hall), the kids are not the least bit interesting. Especially Kate who has an alcoholic father and Juan who has an illegal mother. Steve Guttenberg plays Deputy Palmer who helps coach the team mainly because he has the hots for Anna. As can be predicted, they get good at soccer, and spoilers ahead:,Win the Divisional championship over the Knights and their bad guy coach., Palmer sponsors Juan's mom, ends up with Anna, and Juan and Kate will be a couple "If I leave again I am taking you with me." ( Juan), and perhaps Juan's mom and Kate's dad, it seemed hinted at. Themes like illegal immigration and alcoholism and a remark about Reagan economics that would go straight over a kids head, made you think this is really a kids movie made for adults. It did not do well at the Box Office either. The main reason to watch is Olivia D'Abo. 3/10 stars all for her.$
The Big Green is such a great movie in so many different ways. The overall cast made the movie even better &amp; the storyline line was phenomenal!!! It has laughter throughout the movie, love, sports action and showing how being an minority is very important and key to the movie. I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS MOVIE TO ANYONE!!!!$

Georgia (1995)$
Jennifer Jason Leigh and Mare Winningham are a good match portraying vastly different siblings, but only Winningham is able to bring something convincing or substantial to her role. Leigh, playing bar-band singer and alcoholic Sadie Flood, constantly leans on older sis Georgia, an acclaimed folk singer in the Joni Mitchell mold. Perhaps due to her double duties as co-producer on the film, Leigh seems to have boxed herself into a corner: she isn't credible as a singer and, even if this is intentional, gives herself far too much screen-time at the microphone. Probably hoping for a tour-de-force, Leigh is wire-drawn and nervous and jagged; however, we simply do not see any talent within this character (Leigh is obviously a solid actress, but she makes decisions here that wall us off from her). If Sadie had even the slightest bit of charisma or appeal, we might be able to buy into the concept that she gets the (small) breaks that she does. As it is, the likelihood of her ever getting up on stage is slim. Director Ulu Grosbard crafts a few intense dramatic sequences, and the editing at the finale juxtaposes Sadie's bar performance with Georgia's sold-out arena show--both singing the same song--and it's a sadly nuanced moment...but really, what's the point? *1/2 from ****$
Jennifer Jason Leigh is an incredible actress, climbing into a character and making you feel what the character feels.  She accomplishes that to an intense degree as Sadie Flood in "Georgia."  The problem is that I didn't really want to feel what Sadie felt.  She scared and disgusted me.  Mare Winningham (who knew she had such a clear, sweet singing voice?!?) matches Leigh's believable portrayal, but had a more sympathetic character with which to work.  The stand-out, though, is Max Perlich as Sadie's worshipful husband/doormat.  My heart broke for him.  While the acting was strong, I found this film exhausting and kept checking to see how much time was left - it felt more like an assignment than entertainment.$
This is an independent drama featuring two sisters: Georgia a successful C&amp;W singer and her younger sister Sadie who is a grunge rock chick and that's the story . When I say " story " I don't mean " plot " because unfortunately GEORGIA doesn't have a plot which is a shame since this movie falls short because of its low concept story . It's very well acted by all the cast and Marie Winningham was Oscar nominated as the title character while Jennifer Jason Leigh ( One of America's most underrated actresses of the last two decades ) is superb . Yeah you want to grab hold of Sadie and strangle some sense into her but having an abundance of reckless stupidity is how the character is written and Leigh plays her to perfection . it's just a shame that the film suffers from a lack of incidents in a tale featuring sibling rivalry with the most nail biting moment being when Sadie being refused on a plane because she has no shoes ! Will she get some footwear before the plane leaves ? That's the nearest we get to excitement$
Usually I like films that are good character studies, but Georgia fell flat as a character study. At almost two and a half hours long, the film grew dull and too long very quickly. I have the highest regard for Jennifer Jason Leigh's work as an actress/writer/producer, but I can only hope that her real singing is much better in real life than in this movie! It's just that Leigh's Sadie is an unlikeable, unsympathetic character, and her and Georgia's sibling rivalry is not gone into nearly enough detail to MAKE Sadie a sympathetic character. Mare Winningham does a very good job, and the woman has some beautiful pipes! Who knew? An OK film, but with the talented Leigh at the helm, it should have been MUCH better.$
While I love Mare Winningham and Jennifer Jason Leigh, I felt terrible for the lead character of Sadie Flood who longs for the same success as her older married, conventional sister Georgia. The film earned nominations for Winningham who plays the role with understanding and grace like most of her performances. I just find it so sad for Sadie who is genuinely a tragic figure of a character who loves and is at loss about her relationship with Axel, a quiet pizza guy, who falls in love with her. I remember them hitch-hiking rather than ride in a car with Georgia and her husband. It is a sad, thoughtful movie about sibling rivalry and relationships.$
Jennifer Jason Leigh here pulls off another of her 'impossible' performances. Is there any film actress as versatile as she is? Is there anything she can't do or any role she cannot play? When she acts, she throws herself into the role with the force of an express train. Here she transforms into a hopeless, cheery, ever-smiling flop of a girl, who has failed at everything but just goes on in good humour, taking it on the chin from Life time after time. Her pathetic, sprawling, inept character is endlessly endearing, like a delightful child, even though she drives everyone she knows crazy because she is so hopeless. She can't stay off the drugs, or the booze, or out of bed with anyone for a quickie. She doesn't know when to start, she doesn't know when to stop. She is behaviour-dyslexic. Her thoroughly controlled and successful older sister gets her revenge on little sister by extending icy and permanent tolerance, disguising condescension as devotion. The two sisters are both singers, and the older one, Georgia of the title (though the star is really Sadie, the Leigh character), is a magnificent folk singer with a marvellously controlled and captivating voice (must get Winningham's CDs!). She is played brilliantly by Mare Willingham, who was justly nominated for an Oscar for it. As for Leigh, she won best actress awards from the New York Film Critics Circle Awards (highly prestigious in the USA), and the Montreal Film Festival. Leigh can sing better than she does in the film because it is part of the role that she must not be very good. However, she throws herself totally into every song she sings, and unbearably heart-rending emotion is her specialty. What a contrast to the cold control shown by her sister, who stands erect and formal, while Leigh throws herself all over the stage and repeatedly swallows and vomits up the microphone, and everything hangs out like long johns on the washing line which the neighbours don't want to see. The film is incredibly sensitive and profound, a triumph by Ulu Grosbard, who made too few films in his career, and is now well into his 80s. This is REAL film-making, and one of the endless parade of spectacular achievements by the incomparably brilliant Jennifer Jason Leigh, and surely one of her best.$
This film is a tough one for the viewer. Jennifer Jason Leigh once again grips her character with a choke hold and delivers an amazing performance. The dynamics between these two sisters was heartbreaking, and the love/hate relationship was difficult to watch unfold. I was shocked to see how much JJL with her short haircut at the end looked like her dad, Vic Morrow, when he was young -the spittin' image as they say. JJL has some quirky mannerisms that I find irritating sometimes, but she pulled off a top rate performance with Gloria. I thought about why the film was called Gloria, and decided it was just one more "insult" to Sadie. The name of the film should have been Sadie!!!$
Sadie Flood wants to be a famous singer like her big sister Georgia.But she has her own demons, and she seeks comfort from drugs and alcohol.Georgia (1995) is a music drama directed by Ulu Grosbard.Jennifer Jason Leigh gives a strong performance in the lead playing the troubled singer Sadie Flood.She is the heart and soul of this film, as her on-screen sister Mare Winningham said, but yet only Mare received an Academy Award nomination.Leigh's mother Barbara Turner wrote the film.Ted Levine plays the part of Jake.Max Perlich plays Axel Goldman.John Doe portrays Bobby.John C. Reilly is Herman, the drummer.The late singer Jimmy Witherspoon plays Trucker.The most memorable moment in this movie must be when Sadie sings Van Morrison's Take Me Back with that Janis Joplin voice.If you have some time, don't miss this independent film.$
Again a movie in which Jenny plays a fragile disturbed sibling, who feels inferior compared her successful sister If this rivalry is true among a family and appeals particularly to me, this time, it didn't catch me Usually, I don't like stories featuring a self destructing and lunatic character so here between booze and narcotics, I had enough A bit like her famous sister, it's nearly impossible to have deep and meaningful moments with such people because they are just unreliable and have the super power to drag all their helping hands with them! It's sad to recognize but from my experience and as shown in the movie, only medical professionals people can deal with them! It's indeed after her rehabilitation that a kind Jenny appears and not the crazy one who hides under her dark make-up! This new beginning is the more interesting moment of the movie but it's also already the end. If the songs are much better than the pitiful Begin Again with Keira and Jenny really excels as a singer, at the end, it's for me a difficult movie to watch so I don't think I would repeat the experience ever again!$
I don't know the city. I don't know the music. I don't identify with the scene. But, man, do I know Georgia and Sadie. I'm Sadie; my sister's Georgia, only our ages are reversed. This was the most realistic portrayal of sisters and sibling rivalry I've ever seen. We love and hate and resent and would die for each other too. She's the one I'll miss when I leave this plane. Congratulations to all involved.$
Mare Winningham and Jennifer Jason Lee picked a terrible script to showcase their depth with these sorry characters. Saw this stinker at the box office and to this day It remains at the top of my all time worst experiences at the theater.$

Home for the Holidays (1995)$
People either love or hate this film. It seems to me that, for those who hate it, there is too much going on in the scenes. The dialogue is often open ended, and the action is at times frenetic so that the viewer isn't sure where he/she should be focusing attention. That, I submit, is the true beauty of this unusual movie. It has an over the top realism that makes it a rewarding film to watch multiple times. There are so many layers in the dialogue and the acting, so many subtleties between characters, that you can watch it many times and still be noticing something new. This may be billed a comedy, but it is filled with heartbreak and tragedy, betrayal and disappointments. This is not a run of the mill feel good holiday movie. I think those who rate this movie poorly, in some way, miss that. I hope Jodie Foster directs again. She's immensely gifted.$
This is a great little gem of a film. The whole time i was watching this film i couldn't help but notice the similarities to my family. The craziness, the fights i mean everything. I laughed so hard during this film but mostly when Robert Downey Jr. was on screen. It is not to say that Holly Hunter was bad, she was quite good as was everyone else but Downey had this presense on the screen and he just stole the movie. while it was apparent he was using heavily he was still at his best on screen. The DVD commentary by Jodie Foster really gives insight to the film and it really sounds like Downey was a pain to work with because of his improvising everything but you feel she has a genuine sisterly love for him. Bottom line is that it was a funny, insightful, and realistic film.$
Jodie Foster managed to give us(with an outstanding ensemble of actors)a deliciously written and directed film about the tribulations of belonging to a family and the consequential heartache brought by growing apart from them as one becomes an individual.  The sincerity of the script turns out to be one hell of a smash in the head to anyone that can empathize with the basic situations confronted in a typical holiday gathering. Probably the saddest part(and one that most of us who have brothers/sisters will understand) is the sudden knowledge that blood sometimes isn't enough to love somebody. The crackings in fraternal relationships are deeply touching and hard in this one, and  while it is not my case, I think a mother and father will break a few tears too as the going away of children and subsequent cutting of the umbilical chord is depicted as an evident transformation that is usually more painful to the elder than to the young. The cast is magnificent, and while the film is very simple in its construction, I would avidly recommend it.$
Jodie Foster's second film as director shows her faltering a bit from her debut with the moving, funny "Little Man Tate". Working with an uneven script that is better in its straight dramatic moments than as a comedy, Foster can't get a realistic rhythm going between the disgruntled family members at this Thanksgiving reunion. Every scene involving Geraldine Chaplin as a neurotic aunt is a loss, and Robert Downey, Jr. is awful as the obnoxious gay brother of Holly Hunter. Hunter usually gives flaccid scripts like this a little boost, but even her timing is off (especially in the early introductory scenes, which don't work at all). Finally, as if the clouds parted and clarity shined through, the movie picks up in its final twenty minutes. There's a scathing scene between the sisters ("If I met you on the street--if you gave me your number--I'd throw it away") and Charles Durning's remembrance of his family at the airport is wonderfully wistful. I also admired the final arty shots showing the past and the present (with the camera circling madly, joyfully), and then a crystal clear shot of a plane descending into the velvet sky. Are these moving moments enough to justify the glut of an otherwise overwrought picture? Almost. ** from ****$
Looking at the end credits, the first 9 cast listed are enough star power to illuminate the night. Fantastic cast, stellar performances. Chaotic, peculiar, odd, family dynamics but a wonderful premise that matures at the end of the film. It is the brief, singular moments that rise rise above the clamour of our lives that our resting souls will remember. Great direction from Jodie Foster. I give this film an 8 (great) out of 10. {Frenetic Family Drama}$
I have never written a review before, though I am frequently on IMDB, but now I think it is my duty to let prospective watchers of this movie know that it is really very good. Holly Hunter, Robert Downey Jr, and Anne Bancroft are all highlights. Cynthia Stevenson and Geraldine Chaplin are great too. The story is funny and smart, and Jodie Foster got most of the details right on. Rent this movie on Thanksgiving for the full effect; I do every year.$
It was only just a few years ago that I discovered what I can only describe as an ALL-year-round viewing pleasures movie in 1995s Home For The Holidays! It is a; heart-warming, charming, delightfully funny movie with what I believe to be an All-star cast and an A List Director. IF you are looking for a movie to add to your collection look no further than Home For The Holidays. Rest in peace Ms. Anne Bancroft and Mr. Charles Durning true Hollywood Legends.$
This has become a classic for me, i watch it year after year around the Holiday season. It is a deep movie, with love, laughs &amp; family drama. It makes me think of my family, gives me that feeling of "home". It may hit too close to home for those that have unhappy family ties, mine are close and we all get along so this doesn't ring true for me. Regardless, it's a great film!$
This is a warning to anyone who might think this is a comedy about a dysfunctional family at Thanksgiving dinner. This is in my opinion one of the worst movies ever made, for one simple reason: the actors are allowed to pull out the stops without any dramatic purpose or direction. The holiday gatherings of families are often fraught with tension and conflict and can be the basis of much comedy, but this is hardly a comedy. The character played by Robert Downey Jr. is a mean, selfish, sadistic, substance abusing jerk. That the Holly Hunter character, his sister, puts up with him at all seems to be a serious case of masochism on her part, not a sign of undying sisterly love as the movie suggests. The guy she's going to marry is even worse. What you see is actors exaggerating their parts to the extent that the characters are obliterated. Don't bother.$
My wife got me into this gem of a flick. Actually saw it in the theater. Simple, yet soo funny. A must for every person dreading the season, or for those with odd relatives.$
When I saw this movie for the first time I was 15, and I laughed hysterically!!! Now I'm 26 and just bought the movie and I watch at least 3 times a week. This movie moves you in so many ways. Jodie Foster did an amazing job directing this film, I can't even begin to explain. Lets start with overall feel of the movie, the lighting was superb, it gave it a very cozy feeling to the mood of the movie. The use of random people talking talking about their families was awesome. The lady on the plane was hysterical, it was so real. We have all been there once or twice before sitting next to someone you rather not speak to but can't help but listen to them ramble. She also did a fantastic job with the look of the parents house, so old fashioned yet it still says family, very cozy house. I loved all the clutter and the constant music in the background. And of course the parents were so true to life, it actually makes you feel like your watching a home video.I would go on and on about this movie but I'm limited to the amount of stuff I can put here. I just want everyone to know that they need this movie in there collection, doesn't matter if your 15 or 85. You need to watch this again and again, it truly is an amazing movie!$
The two movies share the same theme: spending a holiday with relatives that turns into a nightmare. Here, it's even better as it's the child (Holly) who returns to her family. It happens to me also and it's true that we travel by grinding our teethes: it warms the heart to see again the family, our familiar places but now, we are adult and it also feels like a cage! Unfortunately, this good plot is totally destroyed by an unintelligible script: the characters speak English, but can someone understand the lines? It's porridge, it means nothing, it's surrealist just to be surrealist and worst, it's not even funny or moving! The aunt is stupid like the sister and brother in law, the mother talks too much for nothing, the father is a video addict! Holly seemed cute, fragile at first but at the end, she didn't do much! In addition, the soundtrack with a lot of bad songs is just irritating and Jodie is there a poor director: all the opening credit is about a painting that we don't see! She zooms in Holly (1,57m) and McDermott (1,83m) so we have only the head of the first and the second has his forehead cut! The only interesting thing is the unrecognizable Robert Downey Jr, so puffy that he looked like a Javier Bardem. Finally, i thought after watching "Always", that Holly was a fine actress but after having watched this crap, stupid "Crash" and her horrible TV show, i really wonder....$

"Postman$
his performance is essence of this adorable film. his character is so careful created that its fragility, humor, innocence, light of details are magnificent. he don't play a role but he is "il postino" . and this fact transforms entire scene. the story of Neruda exile is only arena for emotions of a small man on an Italian isle. the beautiful Beatrice is brick for his delicate happiness. Neruda himself is not exactly a mentor but a gardener. and the music, the extraordinary music, it is the soul of entire poetry. because a poetry is this movie who has as roots poems. very delicate, nice, nostalgic, melancholic, subtle, intelligent, precise, it is wonderful homage to a way to discover life as fundamental miracle. to feel the nuances of love, friendship, to be humble, modest and daring in same time, to feel gratitude as form of respiration. beautiful and impressive. touching. and unique. story of a postman. legacy of Massimo Troisi.$
What a gentle, unassuming movie. When Pablo Neruda arrives on the island, exiled from his native Chile due to his political beliefs, he is a mysterious figure. Women love his work and send him mail by the bushel basket. The principle character has the job of bringing the mail to the hinterland and eventually begins a relationship with the great poet. The postman is a very simple man who really should be ignored or tolerated by Neruda. Instead, the man who loves poetry instills that love in this man who mumbles and stumbles with his words. Eventually they find themselves discussing deeper issues and the Postman begins to realize an intellectual potential. There is a comment later in the movie about ignorant people. He would never have made such a comment early on because of his own self doubts. He at first sees poetry as a way to get girls but later comes to know that he is himself a poet. I loved the wonderful acting and the gentle yet powerful nature of this film.$
I've never seen him in anything else, but this performance by Massimo Troisi touches my soul. Stunning.$
the first name to associate with the film. and, at first sight, the actor who gives charm and force and light to the film. a film about an exile. and a beautiful friendship. a film about miracles and about innocence, about an unknown Neruda and about the passion to live as part of the other. Massimo Troisi has a great merit in this story of a poor man's happiness. but not the only. the music, the landscapes, the small events, the political frame, Philippe Noiret as a kind of Ovidius, far by the ordinary battle, discovering simple life are pieces who transforms Il Postino in memorable experience. a film about human links. poetic, touching, beautiful. maybe, useful.$
Set in a beautiful Italian sea coast village, Il Postino is a gem of a movie. There is an undescribable beauty to it. I appreciate 1) the beauty of the ocean,  2) the lovely music, 3) the Italian language, 4) the poetry of Pablo Neruda, 5) the time that the Nobel Peace Prize poet spends with a poor mail deliverer who comes up hills on his  bicycle, explaining to him what is a metaphor, 6) the beautiful and sincere friendship between the two men, 7) the love that Neruda has for his woman, and 8) how Mario wants to impress the woman of his dreams with nothing else, but the poetry written by Neruda. After his time in asylum Neruda goes back to Chile and his friend Mario misses him.  Later in the movie Neruda returns to the island and realizes how much he misses that honest and simple man who was so eager to learn when they met at the beach town. I love this movie! If I watch it some more my Italian will improve tremendously, I can understand enough to watch the movie and not read the subtitles. I guess that makes the movie more meaningful to me, as I understand it in the language that it was made in. Mario really wanted Neruda to mention him in interviews because he sensed that they both had influenced each others' lives.  Unfortunately when Neruda meets Pablito,  Mario is no longer around. I highly recommend this movie. My favorite scene: Is Neruda explaining to Mario what a metaphor is. That scene also provided me with my favorite quote: Neruda:" Metaphors." Mario: "What are those?" Neruda:" How can I explain, when you talk of something comparing with the other?" Mario: "Something you use in poetry?" Neruda: "Yes! For example: when you say the sky weeps, what do you mean?" Mario: "It is raining." Neruda:" Very good! That is a metaphor."  Mario:"It's easy then. Why has it got such a complicated name?" Neruda: "Man has no business with the simplicity of complexity of things." I have the tape and have enjoyed this movie every time I watched it. This movie deserves every award it has received. It is a wonderful movie.$
Lyrical, moving and beautifully photographed gentle comedy in which an exiled Chilean poet inspires his Italian postman to woo and marry a local girl. Massimo Troisi gives a wonderfully contained performance as the postman who learns to see the beauty in poetry and his home on an Italian island. Philippe Noiret plays the poet Pablo Neruda with the usual assuredness. It is difficult not to be moved by the simple beauty of the film.$
What are the odds of a great French actor, kept fully employed in France, starring in two of the most successful and internationally popular Italian movies of all time.  What a parley for Phillipe Noiret, Cinema Paradiso and Il Postino.  Reading through just the first batch of comments one is almost hoping for a negative reaction to temper the praise - and of course it is there to be found, there is, after all, one in every platoon. It's also ironic that one finds oneself searching for superlatives to describe what is essentially bone simple; what, after all, is more basic than friendship, however unlikely and/or mismatched the participants are.  It's almost embarrassing to watch the amazing Massimo Troisi doing shy, doing humble, doing simple in the best sense of the word.  This is acting of the highest order and in some of their scenes together Philippe Noiret, no slouch by any means, does well to hold his own.  Cynics - and I like to think I have a healthy streak of cynicism in my own make up - may well question the odds against a simple, barely articulate fisherman's son living in a remote backwater metamorphosing into an erudite public speaker after a short exposure to a world-class poet but wiser heads are happy to put cynicism on hold and wallow in the elements - music, scenery, local color, the human condition and most of all great acting - that fuse together seamlessly and make this a must-see movie.  10/10$

"Indian in the Cupboard$
I must first say I was shocked to see that the average rating given this film was below 6 (when I checked it in Jan of '05). While I gave it a 10, I fully expected at least a mid 7 from the IMDb audience. It is a wonderful film that I love to show to my children. What's not to like? It has a unique plot - that of an Indian coming to life in a young boy's cupboard, and wonderful acting and music. Through the boy's experiences with the Indian (wonderfully played by Litefoot) he comes to a new level of maturity. Hal Scardino's acting is natural and totally believable. If you are tired of the cut-out child actors that Hollywood gives us too often, then you'll love Hal. What a fabulously underplayed performance. The ending always makes me and my wife cry. There are so few really good films for children. I hate to suffer through other films I bought for the kids (like "Inspector Gadget" - a truly awful film) and I wish that there were more films like this one. This is a wonderful film and I heartily recommend it.$
Why this movie doesn't have an average of around 9 eludes me.  It is a wondeful film.  So well acted and with a very engaging story.  This is a great film for the whole family.  You'll love it. The lead actor - Hal Scardino - is such a natural.  He's completely believable, as is his friend. The Indian is also wonderfully brought to life.  How they made the special effects work so well back in 1995 (well... that was a while back for film special effects anyway...) I don't know.  I wish we could see more warm hearted films like this today.$
Underrated and highly involving movie for kids. A young boy finds out that his cupboard has magical powers and can turn plastic into reality. He first turns a plastic Indian into a real human being. The movie teaches about responsibility but in an understandable way. It isn't patronizing nor childish, which means older audiences should relate to it also. It also mediates on life and death at certain points, and was the first film in a long time to be genuinely emotionally shocking. The relationship between the Indian and the cowboy was very well developed as they started to bond over their tragedies. The film does have a number of loose edges. Rishi Bhat was particularly annoying at times, but in a way he was necessary to play off Scardino. Even Scardino wasn't always a lovable protagonist. In one scene he kicks his brother's pet rat down the stairs, in an event where the rat clearly would have died. As the film hadn't relied on cartoon logic up until that point it was a bit out of place. Great effects, and seeing Darth Vader vs. a T-Rex kind of made up for those moments. A more innocent time when children's movies didn't have to be loud and crass.$
The Indian in the Cupboard (1995): Dir: Frank Oz / Cast: Hal Scardino, Litefoot, David Keith, Rishi Bhat, Steve Coogan: Imaginative film full of glorious visual wonders about ancestry. The cupboard represents time lapse and the uniting of two worlds or cultures. Omri is given a small plastic Indian figurine with a cupboard. He locks the Indian in the cupboard and discovers the figure come to life. His name is Little Bear and the story never indicates how the cupboard sustains such power. It is disturbing to see these lives in the care of a kid. Directed by Frank Oz who normally makes comedies such as Dirty Rotten Scoundrels, but here he aims at family and fantasy viewers. Hal Scardino plays this kid given a key that holds no explanation, and he is given a responsibility that seems much for a kid his age. Litefoot plays the wise Little Bear but we are given little if any background, but the plot gears towards his dealing with his size verses the world he now inhabits. David Keith is hilarious as cowboy Boone, and easily the film's best performance. Boone enters as a pushover but becomes peaceful after an incident. Rishi Bhat is suitable as Scardino's best friend and soon he attempts to expose the figures. Steve Coogan plays a medical figurine who treats Little Bear when he is wounded. Theme of ancestry make the cupboard worth opening but caution issued for young viewers. Score: 9 / 10$
This film was special. It's not to say it ranks high amongst the worlds films technically (which is not to say it fails in this regard  it simply does not depend upon special effects), but the underlying theme is gentle and beautifully presented. The child actors' performances are solid. Especially the lead 'Omri', and his friend (whom I really liked and really disliked respectively - (hence his acting ability)). It's an innocent story with great imagination, and doesn't take itself too seriously. The relationship and growth that the main character develops with Little Bear (the Indian in the cupboard) is special. It eventually takes on a father/son dynamic after a role reversal or sorts from the Creator/created dynamic the boy has with Little Bear at first. I was touched by this relationship and by Omri's innocence. Frank Oz imagination is conveyed well through this work. I can easily imagine being in Omri's shoes and enjoy this film each time I watch it. Whether you watch this with kids or not, odds are you'll enjoy it.$
Actually quite sweet and enjoyable. But, Patrick and Omri (Stupid name) are so damn irritating, and when Omri kicks the rat, what the hell. God, no offence to the actor, but Omri has such an annoying face, and these emotional scenes which are featured in the film are just ruined by close-ups of his stupid face. Apart from that, it is quite sweet, quite sad and decently fun. I genuinely recommend this if you fancy killing some time.$
I remember seeing TV adverts for this film when it was released, around the same time as Jumanji and Toy Story, it was beaten at the box-office by movies like Batman Forever, Pocahontas and Apollo 13, but it was rated well, and I was told it was worthwhile, so I looked forward to it, directed by Frank Oz (The Dark Crystal, The Muppets Take Manhattan, Little Shop of Horrors, Bowfinger). Basically in Brooklyn, on his ninth birthday, Omri (Hal Scardino) receives an old cupboard from his brother Gillon (Vincent Kartheiser) and a little Native American "Indian" figure made of plastic from his best friend Patrick (Rishi Bhat). That night, Omri goes through his mother's old box of keys to find one that will open the cupboard, he finds a gold-coloured key with a red ribbon that fits the keyhole, he can only fit his Indian figurine inside. In the morning, Omri hears a tapping coming from inside the cupboard, he opens it up and finds a small living person hiding in the corner. It is the Indian figurine who has magically come to life in human form, the Indian is frightened by his large acquaintance and stabs him in the finger with his small knife. Omri's father Victor (Richard Jenkins) comes into the room to help him get ready for school, the child locks the cupboard and keeps the Indian a secret. When Omri returns home from school, he is upset to find the Indian figurine has returned to its original form as a toy, he locks the cupboard again. In bed, Omri once again hears tapping, he opens the cupboard and finds the Indian alive once again, the Indian is again frightened, but they start talking and slowly form a friendship. The Indian reveals himself as an English-speaking, 18th-century Iroquois Indian named Little Bear (Litefoot) who was fighting in the French and Indian War alongside the British. Omri does some research and learns a lot about the Iroquois and learns that Little Bear has a deceased wife. Omri takes Little Bear outside, but he is hurt by a pigeon, Omri brings to life a figurine of a First World War British Army medic named Tommy Atkins (Steve Coogan) to treat Little Bear's wound. As time goes by, Omri and Little Bear become closer as friends, the boy gives him tools to build a longhouse, they share stories, and Omri decides to surprise him, bringing to life a Chieftain Indian figure. But the shock of seeing a large boy causes the old man to suffer a heart attack, seeing his confusion, Little Bear realises that Omri really is a child, and not a great spirit as he assumed, he warns Omri not to tamper with magic he does not understand. Omri has a bit of friction with his father, about using his tools without permission, they make amends, and Omri tries to show his maturity by buying some tools for his father from the store. At the store, Omri runs into his friend Patrick, who is carrying a plastic figurine of a cowboy riding a horse. Omri eventually reveals his secret to Patrick, but Little Bear is hiding, and begs the boy to send him home. Ignoring Omri protesting, Patrick brings his cowboy figurine "Boohoo" Boone (David Keith) to life, the cowboy and the Indian are initially hostile towards each another but are told to behave themselves. Omri reluctantly accepts Patrick's request to bring Little Bear and Boone to school, the two boys have an argument in the hallway and almost get caught by a teacher (Nestor Serrano), but they fool him the teacher and reconcile. Back home, Omri intends to bring to life a female Indian figurine to give Little Bear a new wife, but he finds the key to the cupboard is missing, brother Gillon confesses he dropped the key in the crawlspace, to get back at him. That night, Omri and Patrick, along with Little Bear and Boone, watch television, and a cowboys and Indians show, Boone is enthusiastic, while Little Bear watches in horror, and in confusion hearing gunshots he fires an arrow into Boone's chest. Later that night, Omri and Patrick find the key jammed between two floor boards, Little Bear goes under the floor and finds the key, just before he is nearly killed by the escaped pet rat. In the cupboard, Omri brings Tommy Atkins back to life to treat Boone's wounds, Omri comes to the realisation it is time to return Little Bear and Boone to their respective time periods where they belong. After Tommy Atkins returns to his own time, Boone awakens and forgives Little Bear, Omri wants to bring to life a female Indian figurine, so he is not alone, but agrees not to do so. The next morning, Omri and Patrick say their goodbyes to their friends before locking them back in the cupboard, sending them home and turning them back into figurines. In the end, Omri returns to school, he will never know where or how Little Bear may be, but he does not worry about him anymore. Also starring Lindsay Crouse as Jane, Lucas Tejwani and Leon Tejwani as Baby Martin and Sakina Jaffrey as Lucy. It is a very simple tale, a little boy with a magical cupboard that when locked can bring any toy figure to life, rap artist Litefoot gives a good performance as the transformed toy Indian, and Keith and Coogan are likeable when they are on, the small and large worlds clashing format is well done, there are good special effects, it is sweet-natured and has good messages about responsibility, and it makes you laugh and emotional at the right moments, one for all the family, a most watchable fantasy adventure. Very good!$
Now that I've grown and educated myself, I can't stop thinking about how politically incorrect the title is. People say it should be called 'the Native American in the cupboard'. This is a very very common misconception in America. Yes, for a while they were called Indians. Christopher Columbus did not call them Indians because he thought they were from India. He called them "Gods people". The word in his language for "God's people" sounds very similar to the word Indian that we use today. It's just that the pronunciation we use now has changed a little after all this time. As for people saying that the "correct" term is "Native American" is highly offensive and frankly kind of stupid. How is it that taking the name from which the conquerors's gave them(American) supposed to be the correct term? That makes absolutely no sense. The word American has no relation whatsoever to Indian culture. Therefore "Native American" is utterly ridiculous, as well. If there is to be a title, it's should be call 'The Iroquois in the Cupboard'. No matter, what it is, call. The movie and book is not racist. The movie and book is trying to show tolerance through it's metaphor for how ignorant people have subjugated and marginalized the Indian populations of America by refusing to understand, listen to, or accommodate Indian heritage. The film opens up, a lot of things that people rarely knew about Native Americans. The film starts with a young boy, Omri (Hal Scardino), receives a cupboard. He uses a "magical" key, which belonged to his great-grandmother, to bring a plastic 18th century Native American figurine to life with the cupboard. The now-living Iroquois reveals his name as Little Bear (Litefoot). Litefoot, a real rapper does a great job in teaching role, not only in teaching the child about Iroquois's culture, but also the morality of playing God. There is a Frankenstein feel to the film. My favorite line in the film "God does play with little men'. Author Lynne Reid Banks and Director Frank Oz did an excellent job conveying the worry and angst the young boy felt for for his little toy come to life. I appreciate how the author had the boy evolve from seeing the Indian as a plaything to realizing that, regardless of his size, the Indian was a person with needs, feelings, and a right to live his life. What struck me about it was not that it was racist, or dated (it didn't feel so as much as you'd think,) but that it is a deconstruction of the idea that magical toys would be fun to have, and possibly of imagination as well. Omri seem just the typical kid protagonist, kinda generic if you ask me. But I still think his acting was unintentionally funny. Just weird out with all the close ups on Omri's face, the odd relationship between him and Little Bear, the weird fears, and how he reacts to others. Examples when Omri's dad confronts him about the saw blades, and Omri says he buried them. Odd lying by him and his parent accept that lame excuse. What kid can cuss to his mom as well? What is with his relationship with brothers being super cool in the beginning of the film and then for no reason Omri turns into a complete jerk with him? The worst thing, the kid does is abuse an animal. That poor thing was abused through the whole film. Whether it was real or not, it was still animal abuse and shouldn't be shown in this movie. The treatment of that rat was appalling. Omri still wasn't nearly as annoying as his friend, Patrick. One minute he's Omri's best friend, and all docile and quiet, and then like a switch, he's evil and defiant with seeing them as nothing more than animated toys. He brings in Boone (David Keith), a bigot Injun hating cowboy whom at first conflict with Little Bear, but grows to be friends with him, once they got to know each other. One of the odd things about the film is scenes that go nowhere or has nothing to do with the story like the Mohawk bully. Another thing is the degrading of women in the film, from the kids watching Montley Crue 'Girls' music video (it's the 1990's, why were they watching it anyways?) to Bear demanding a wife so she can cook. I put aside my critiques and squelched my inner squirming and found much to like about the film. The special effects were top notch, and it was really neat to see Little Bear, Boone and Tommy (Steve Coogan) the medic brought to life on the screen. It was pretty cool to see the Star Wars, Jurrasic Park, G.I Joe, and Robo-Cop reference. The movie is pretty close to the book, minus little changes such as the toy shop. I laugh at the kid that loves JFK. While the movie isn't that bad, it's not going to hurt the kids watching it. I like it when I was a kid and still kinda do.$
On this one, I am surprised that viewers are so critical as to miss the big picture of the magical moments and concepts of the movie. I agree, there are quite a few flaws overall, but some are just direction or editing oversights. However, this film deserves to be recognized as a really good family film as is. There are so many good "teaching moments" for parents regarding what kids go through growing up. The effects were well done for the time, playing the small vs. big people visuals. I was absorbed in the story well beyond picking on every detail. Omri was decent, not great, but believable as the kid star; the casting and scripting both for Little Bear are compelling, fascinating, and wonderful. I would recommend this film to almost anyone, if their reality can be suspended for 96 minutes. It is a great story, if only a good film. Entertaining and more gripping than many films since.$
The Indian in the Cupboard is a delightful movie.  The sweet and adorable Omri (played by Hal Scardino) is great to go along with on this fascinating adventure.   The character Omri is a perfect portrayal of a sensitive and thoughtful 9 year old boy.    This movie is most enjoyable in that aspect, above and beyond the story of the strange abilities of the cupboard.$
I loved this movie almost as much as Hal Scardino, who plays Omri, had me believing he loved Little Bear. As life's lessons go, Indian in the Cupboard teaches many of the best about friendship and responsibility while providing spirited entertainment for young and old.$
I'll admit...when I first saw the movie, I thought it was the best movie ever. Then, I read the books. This movie strays very far from the book. The big problem is the fact that the books take place in England. And if you read the rest of the books, you'll know how important the location is to the entire story. The movie Americanizes Omri. The movie cuts out and replaces a lot of scenes as well. For instance, in the movie, Boone never sits in the art class drawing his microscopic sketch of his town...a scene that would play an big role in a book to come. Another scene they cut was the principal seeing Little Bear and Boone the way Omri and Patrick do...another big scene that follows them throughout the series. Perhaps they did this because there were no plans for sequels. However, it makes for a huge disappointment for viewers who had read the books before or ran right to the books afterward. The acting and casting for the time travelers, however, was wonderful. As I read the books, I picture Litefoot speaking all Little Bear's lines, Steve Coogan speaking all Tommy's lines, and David Keith speaking Boone's lines. I loved the special effects throughout the movie. The fact that all the others were Americanized causes me to realize they don't fit the Omri, Patrick, etc in the books. Overall, I say that if you enjoy it, then you enjoy it. But chances are, when you read the books, you'll find it a definite disappointment, as it is with so many other book-based movies.$
SPOILERS PROBABLE - I'm well past my childhood, but I really liked this movie. It may not follow the exact story of the Lynn Reid Banks story, but it almost definitely captures the spirit of it as Hal Scardino as Omri (where did such a name come from ?) learns the trials and tribulations of self-discovery, tolerance and life and death. Litefoot plays a wonderful role as the Indian brought to life, but I also suspect he may have had a little hand in the production guiding and eliminating several Native American stereotypes from the production. I do admit being quite a bit intrigued by the power of the cupboard and/or key as by some of the toys brought to life seem to actually hold the consciousnesses of actual individuals returned to life. If so, then the cupboard is merely a time machine of sorts, but there is a very cute, albeit brief scene where Omri brings to life a few of his action figures and discovers how dangerous they are with their phony weapons transformed into their real life equivalents. Among which is a dinosaur possibly from his Jurassic Park collection. He could have kept the creature alive and sold it for a million at his local Natural History Museum. He also doesn't have any comic book superheroes to bring to life; what a chance he missed ! I can only wonder if a barbie doll would have come out looking like Anna Nicole Smith ! Despite infinite possibilities, the movie is really better centered on Omri's self-discovery through the Indian than several experiments with the cupboard. Little Bear (Litefoot) explains it all so well: "You should not play with magic you do not understand !"$
I have just to take a look at the face of my children (5 and 3 years old) each time we watch the film together to see the magic of the movie. Friendship and responsability are esential in our Society, and of course as we can see every day, are not very common. Personally I find nice the english soldier performance, and one of last scenes when Little foot turns big and is looking at Omri. The music is also great.$
"The Indian in the Cupboard" is a generally acceptable film, but it could have been MUCH better. Although it lacks originality, its story had potential, but somehow the result falls short. Arguably the most crucial weakness is that it stretches credibility to the limit; the basic premise of toys coming to life is easy enough to accept, but the suggestion that the toys have their own, secret, private lives even when they are seemingly soulless pieces of plastic, is really hard to swallow. Moreover, the film would me more fun if it allowed its characters to explore the possibilities and activities of "the real world", but they seem to suffer from melancholia and boredom and they just want to "go back". The special effects are excellent, and the film does have a couple of inventive moments, but too much moralizing and plodding pacing make it seem longer than it is. 5/10 would be a fair rating, I think.$

Eye for an Eye (1996)$
This movie has been reviewed into overkill by many others on this board, so I will spare you another home-viewer's two thumbs down. However I would like to state that I am EXTREMELY surprised that no one has commented about the actual rape scene itself. I can remember watching this as a kid on Lifetime, and years later still remembering that scene to a chilling degree. In most cases for rape scenes, (at least the ones aired on television) they only get from the waist up in the shot. In this particular scene, the camera is aimed straight ahead at the rapist in a sitting position on the floor with the young girl laying out in front of him. Although there is no nudity involved, the scene is VERY graphic in nature. I don't know how in the world they got that girl to play out the scene so well, but I could actually feel her pain, as depicted in her face and screaming from being ripped apart. It was enough make me sick my stomach then as a child, and now as an adult.$
Karen is a normal woman living a normal upper class life with her husband and her two daughters until one day she calls home on her cell phone, and Julie (her 17 year old daughter) answers. Julie is preparing for her sister Megan's 6th birthday at the time of the call, and Karen is still talking to her when someone suddenly breaks into the house and attacks Julie. Trying to get another cell phone in order to call the police for help, Karen rushes home as fast as she can, and is devastated by what has happened. Julie was raped and murdered. After Julie's killer, Robert Doob,a supermarket deliveryman is unfairly released. Karen takes on a somewhat different perspective on life. She devotes her life to hunt down the man who killed her daughter and in order to find him, Karen has to descend into a world she never knew existed. EYE FOR AN EYE is a very dark film about obsession and revenge and the price everybody involved has to pay. It's not the kind of film that tries to deliver a vision of hope, but rather a sinister world of cynicism. The only escape for Karen (and everybody else) seems to be the kind of love Karen shows for her daughter Megan, her husband and her friends.$
...seems to have enraged some viewers of this film.  The bad guy is really bad.  Guess what, they're like that in the real world too.  There are plenty of bad guys out there who have no redeeming qualities and do laugh at the system, assuming it will never be able to really punish them.  I found this movie very believable and thought the acting was terrific and the climax very satisfying.  It was nice to see something come out of Hollywood that wasn't skewed in perspective by the left coast that produced it.  Anybody who thinks Robert Doob as a character is too one-dimensional to be believable has never met a violent criminal in the flesh.$
I am giving this a Full 10 out of 10 why? Because if this really happened in a Home there will always be a MOM OR DAD. To Deal with that Slim Ball. I know I Would if anyone hurt my daughter or son I would do the same. The Law today kind of sucks. Is any of this Story Telling the TRUTH. I would have to say Yes. There is alot of crimes committed and men and women get away with. Why mostly because of the Lawyer's making MONEY.$
A mediocre drama with Fields at the vortex, "Eye For an Eye" attempts to exploit the hate we all feel at heinous crime and the natural inclinations toward uncivilized retribution when the crime goes unpunished. Fields plays a woman whose daughter has been raped and murdered by the sneering Sutherland who is so evil he not only rapes and murders twice in the film but he pours hot coffee on a dog. Now that's evil.  Such is the mentality behind this film in which the good are very good and the bad are very bad and the plot is as obvious as the "E" on an eye chart. An okay watch if there's nothing better to be found while channel surfing.$
As one reviewer put it, we can chop it up ten different ways, but did it keep you entertained, yes it definately does. I gave it a 7 and would of been higher except a few minor things like predictably, loose ends on sublots, like at the end she did nothing wrong really, but mostly since you can see that camera crew in very beginning before the Train Wreck rape scene and Insay that since it is hard to watch but hard to look away. Like someone said intense everytime you watch and I mean 90% of it. Keifer is one of my favs I like him as villain. Esp in Phone Booth. Another good one. This movie is I feel more than exceptional and doesn't hold back. Brutal but with the right intent. An stuff like this happens. I like when she follows him the best. Plahouse scene was high suspense, ending needed fine tuned (the way final scene plays out how both hesitate and gun is empty) plus the scene earlier where she clearly parks her car before him. Minus a few of these bloopers I still think it is a thought provoking bone chilling thriller that goes over a tough subject a diff angle (for those who always go back to Dead Man Walking) we know still above average. Oh and who cares if it's a revenge flick duh it is clear about that. People who complain about all that are gonna find something no matter what. That's why sometimes we suspend our disbelief!$
If you like Sally Field, you'll love this movie because she does what Sally does best . . . intense drama! I think she should have won an Academy Award for her portrayal of Karen, the horrified, devastated, angry, Mom/wife whose beautiful teen-age daughter was brutally raped &amp; murdered by a wacko delivering groceries! She was every bit as good as she was in "Norma Rae" and "Places in the Heart"! Some say the movie was not realistic . . obviously you've never been poor or lived in bad neighborhoods, because this kind of stuff happens everyday! The way the justice system works was very realistic also. Gee, let me throw out the name O.J. Simpson! . . I rest my case! Granted the movie was very graphic but so is violent crime in real life! It was very realistic! I cried and grieved (having lost a loved one to violent crime myself) and was angry and revengeful right along with her. I wanted to reach thru the screen and strangle Robert Doob (Kiefer Sutherland, who should of won a best supporting actor award) the cocky, cold, malicious killer, who had no respect for human life and thought he was above the law! I hated him! And I would have done exactly what Sally Fields did if that was my only recourse get justice done! He was clever but she outsmarted him at his own game and did it within the law! This movie was so moving, I was an emotional wreck at the end just like Sally was! I thought the whole cast did a very good job and that the movie was underrated because of it's content. Not everyone wants to watch something so intense. After a hard day at work, I prefer to sit down to something lighthearted like comedy but this one was just to good to pass up!$
Bumfuzzled screenplay by Amanda Silver and Rick JaffaIt, working from Erika Holzer's novel, is such a contrived mess that it's amazing it attracted the likes of Sally Field and Ed Harris (not to mention director John Schlesinger, still in "Pacific Heights" mode). The leads play a married couple mourning the death of their daughter, murdered at home by a psychopath; mom soon begins stalking the creep, freed from prison on one of those movie technicalities. Barely two-dimensional, the picture could be filed under Thrillers For Dummies. Schlesinger underlines every plot point twice, just so we in the audience don't miss a trick; meanwhile, Harris' father is so weak-willed he can't even hold an intelligent conversation with his wife about the death penalty without looking stunned into submission. Kiefer Sutherland's killer is, naturally, full of color and audience-rousing nastiness. This presents another problem: why make a disgusting, immoral punk so vivacious? It's almost as if Schlesinger is saying life is suburbia turns us all into robots...or maybe targets. *1/2 from ****$
You know, as a law school student just about to become a lawyer, I'm much aware of the problems that making justice by yourself can cause to a whole society. That being said, I imagined this movie would try to justify the unjustifiable, but it surprisingly goes in a different direction. The victim's mother becomes obsessive after her daughter gets murdered, but the film never wants to show that she could just murder the bad guy and get easily away with murder. That proves this movie isn't cheesy or formulaic, as I was expecting. The family portrayed in here is very believable and likable, thanks to a great performance made by the three of them-- with highlights to Sally Field, who had an unintentionally funny scene when she swears at the sheriff. Also, directing is professional, doing just like many suspenseful thrillers from the nineties have done. The plot is coherent and well developed, allowing the spectator to understand why the characters were doing what they did, leaving almost no space for doubts. Kiefer Sutherland surely had no hard time on portraying such character, given he did a lot of psychos in the past. All in all, "Eye for an Eye" proves to be a mature film that many of you might enjoy. Recommended.$
This movie is wonderful. The criticism is ridiculous$
EYE FOR AN EYE is an intense, nail-biting thriller that has a good message and taut direction. The script is from the people who wrote HAND THAT ROCKS THE CRADLE, and this is just as intense. While the whole cast delivers fine performances, Kiefer Sutherland is the one who stands out and does a creepy job. It may be hard to watch at times, but I thought it was a rather moving and powerful film.$
"Eye for an Eye" (1996): Starring Sally Field, Ed Harris, Kiefer Sutherland, Beverly D'Angelo, and Joe Mantegna. Our stories tell us where we've been, where we are, and where we hope to go. THIS story is a Where We Are type. A family loses a loved one to violence. If that wasn't enough, the perpetrator doesn't see justice. Each deals with it in their own way, and everyone changes. Slowly we head towards an inevitable encounter. Sally Fields is great as a person torn over how to go on, Ed Harris does his classic stoic/occasionally almost emotional role, Joe Mantegna is very good as a hard working cop, and Kiefer Sutherland is great as a true sociopath. This is a tense drama that doesn't jump over scenes for the sake of reaching a climax. It's not that the characters are the most complex or unique in film history  but they ring true  and there in lies the strength of "Eye for an Eye". It could have been ANY of us.$

Mr. Holland's Opus (1995)$
Richard Dreyfuss is outstanding (as is the whole cast) in this thoroughly enjoyable film.  I really liked it the first time, but with repeated viewings, I'd say that this film got even better.  It's a little predictable, but so what?  For me, it was impossible not to care about these characters, and the ending was the perfect heartwarming note to go out on. It was rather funny as well, but my favourite thing about this movie was the music.  It seems only fitting, considering the importance of music to this film, that it would have a great number of songs, but I was astonished by how much I LOVED the music in this movie.  All-in-all, this was a completely satisfying film, and I would call it a must-see.$
Richard Dreyfus should've won the Oscar nomination, he did a riveting job! The storytelling with everything is so good between the teaching and family. Stephen Herek directed such a charming musical delight that I should've seen sooner. Mr. Holland's Opus was much more than I expected, should've had at least 5 nominations instead of one! The sound is magical throughout, pleasant surprise of entertainment that I'd recommend to anyone.$
Taking a position as a high school music teacher in order to pay the bills, an aspiring composer finds the job unexpectedly challenging but also unexpectedly rewarding in this Oscar nominated drama starring Richard Dreyfuss. The film gets off to a solid start with Dreyfuss discovering his every preconception of teaching challenged; there is no "free time", "high school is not a democracy" and it is absolutely impossible to leave campus at the same time as his students do. The movie missteps though by not spending more time on this section of his journey; before long, Dreyfuss transforms into an obsessively motivated teacher who has simply come to accept the demands of the job. A deaf son is eventually thrown into the mix to give Dreyfuss a chance to realise how his obsession with his job is negatively impacting on home life, but there is nothing especially novel or exciting about this plot development. A maudlin music score does not help matters either. In fact, were it not for its towering lead performance, 'Mr. Holland's Opus' would be difficult to endure. Fortunately, Dreyfuss is in fine form, credibly ageing over 30 years during the course of the movie. The film also does a good job capturing his reactions to various historical events over the three decades portrayed on screen (his grief over John Lennon's death is highly memorable). Whether this alone is enough to render the film worth viewing may vary per viewer. Clocking in at nearly two and half hours long, the film is not an easy, breezy watch, but fans of its lead actor might well find it worthwhile.$
As an out-of-work teacher, I can see and understand Glenn Holland's desire to do more than just be remembered as a teacher but to create a piece of work. As an English teacher, I too aspire to break out the best novel to pull me out of my world. Teaching is hard and rewarding. It's not easy. Don't let anybody fool you otherwise. Richard Dreyfuss' performance as Glenn Holland is not only memorable but unforgettable one of his best roles. Glenne Headly is terrific as his wife. He has a fantastic supporting cast like Olympia Dukakis, William H. Macy, Jay Thomas, Alicia Witt, and others to support the film. The film is kind of a downer about a man who has spent thirty years of his life as a teacher in a small town. I was troubled by the fact that he and his wife stopped having children after Cole was born. I thought the deafness was to create friction between the musical father and his deaf son. Still, it's a good film. You'll cry a little.$
The make-up department does a splendid job in ageing Richard Dreyfuss in Stepehen Herek's film about an aspiring composer turned music teacher who finds his vocation over thirty years. It's a good performance from Dreyfuss as well, and the movie also benefits from a reliably creepy turn from William Macy as Dreyfusss' boss. In fact, as a portrait of a life set against a changing political, and musical, landscape, showing how (in the words of a song that features in the plot), "life is what happens while we're busy making plans", it reminded me of the epic BBC drama series, 'Our Friends in the North'. But it lacks the deeper engagement of that series with the specifics of the times it portrays, and at times seems a little trite as a result. Dreyfuss was Oscar-nominated for his role and this is definitely the sort of film that gets considered at these awards: earnest, gently liberal, ultimately upbeat and essentially unthreatening. And you can take that as condemnation or commendation, as you will; but I enjoyed it.$

Don't Be a Menace to South Central While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood (1996)$
Spoofing practically every "growing up in the hood" movie, "Don't Be a Menace to South Central While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood" is a laugh a minute. Following the adventures of Ashtray (Shawn Wayans) and Loc Dog (Marlon Wayans) in LA's black ghetto, it's one joke after another - the way that a Mel Brooks or Leslie Nielsen movie is. Probably the funniest scene is when they enter a convenience store. The owner, convinced that African-Americans would only enter his store to steal things, follows them around - while a rich white man comes in and proceeds to empty the place. Containing virtually every imaginable use of the N-word, "DBAMTSCWDYJITH" is pure hilarity. Those Wayans brothers have it down.$
You have to watch a few other movies first to really appreciate this. The main two movies you have to watch first is Menace II Society and Boyz N The Hood. 'Don't Be A Menace To South Central While Drinking Your Juice In The Hood' spoofs these two to the max but if you haven't seen these two movies most of this movie will be lost on you. It pretty much is good from beginning to end and i can't think of anything bad to say about it. I particularly like the scene with Officer Self Hatred. This movie isn't a total spoof of movies with a couple of original jokes here and there. The Wayans brothers are good in whatever movie they are in so go watch 'White Chicks' and the first two Scary Movie's. If you like this then i also recommend 'CB4' which is equally hilarious. 9/10$
Shawn and Marlon Wayans, along with director Paris Barclay, have created a very humorous satire of the flood of films recently dealing with African-American life in the ghettos of inner-cities of America.  "Boyz in the Hood" and "Menace II Society" are among the films at which the Wayans brothers poke fun.  "Don't be a Menace..." follows the story of Ashtray(Shawn Wayans) as he wades through a series of episodes in Barclay's "hood."  He lives with his father, who is "only a couple of years older than him."  Among the lessons his father teaches him are:  "No smokin' my shit, no drinkin' my shit, and if you bring any of them hos up in here, make sure I fuck 'em first", and (drinking and driving)"That shit is fun, man!"  No stereotype or politically-correct boundary is too sacred for the Wayans brothers to poke fun at.  Some of the jokes hit, some miss, and the fun will definitely be increased by those who have seen the films that "Don't Be A Menace..." frequently jests.  Not extremely culturally-important fare, but a good laugh, nonetheless.$
Besides having a title that is funny in itself, Don't Be A Menace To South Central While Drinking Your Juice In The Hood is one of the funniest movies this decade. It spoofs such black films as Boyz N' Tha Hood, Dead Presidents, Juice, Menace II Society, and South Central with such hilarity that you'll be repeating its many classic lines over and over again for months. Wayans brothers who started on In Living Clor and made the hilarious 1988 movie I'm Gonn Git U Sucka do it again with this long overdue spoof of movie that are extremely serious. Classic lines and memorable scenes saturate this movie beginning to end. All characters are well acted and comic pacing and sight gags are at a peak not reached since Top Secret or Naked Gun. Multiple viewings add to the fun. Hilarious. I was foolin` y`all! Those was jokes!$
This film is one of the best spoof films i have seen in a while. The Wanyes brothers bring their unique comedy style to a great comedy. i suppose you have to have seen all of the films which they are making fun of to fully appreciate the comedy but once you have seen Menace II Society, Boyz 'n' the Hood, Friday And Higher Learning you will want to watch  this film over and over again$
Easier times, less people offended and then there's this film. LOVE IT!!!$
This spoof of early-1990s "hood" movies is like an R-rated "Naked Gun" - on crack. It's sometimes funny and clever (I liked the gag of father and son being the same age (!), or the raining autumn leaves), other times vulgar and witless. And it's too long (a full 90 minutes) for this kind of plot-less parody. The title may be the best joke of them all! ** out of 4.$
Man i just got done seeing this movie for the first time and it almost brought a tear to my eye.  It was the most impressive and funny movie since "I'm Gonna Get You Sucka" them Wayans boys are at it again and they keep on making me proud.  Two thumbs up.  I gave this movie a 10 by the way.$
It probably would have helped if I'd seen all (or at least some) of the movies that this parodies, but as it stands, DON'T BE A MENACE is consistently funny enough on its own. From the Wayans' Brothers, DON'T BE A MENACE parodies/spoofs just about every "hood" movie from the 90's, like BOYZ N THE HOOD, MENACE 2 SOCIETY, etc. Shawn Wayans stars as Ashtray, a 19-year-old who moves in with his younger (than him) father, and Marlon Wayans as Loc Dog, one of his friends. If there's one big weakness, it's that there's not really a plot to speak of, meaning that the film plays like a series of skits rather than a cohesive story. That being said, there were a lot of laugh-out-loud moments and funny running gags. The best ones, to me, were Keenen Ivory Wayans as the mailman who pops up from time to time and says "Message!" whenever the "preachy" moments come. Also, everyone (and I mean everyone) drinks only malt liquor. Generally, the humor that works the best has to do with pointing out stereotypes in these types of movies (and life in general), rather than the scatological stuff which was often a little too gross for me. Thankfully, it wasn't relied upon as much as it is now in movies of this ilk, but fart jokes and foul-mouthed grannies will only get you so far. For those types of jokes, they were funny the first few times, but became a little tiresome later. This is also an extremely quotable movie, with such memorable lines as, "Break yo self, fool!" So, while I haven't seen really any of the movies this parodied, I have seen other Wayans' Brothers movies and this compares favorably to those. I'd consider this the last genuinely good spoof from them, even if the story structure is all but nonexistent. It doesn't really live up to Mel Brooks (but honestly, what can?), but as a distillation of 90's urban movie clichés, DON'T BE A MENACE is on fairly solid ground.$
After their brother Keenen had such success spoofing blaxploitation films in 1988 with I'M GONNA GIT YOU SUCKA!, Wayans brothers Marlon and Shawn tackle urban dramas in this spoof.  Like SUCKA, this combines an AIRPLANE! type approach to humor with a knowing wink at African-American culture.  It runs out of steam near the end, and some of it isn't funny, but most of it is, and what matters most in this type of movie is how many jokes work vs. how many don't.  The ones that do (especially when Marlon meets an attractive woman from the hood who has seven kids, and when she says to them, "Now what do we say to the nice man?" they reply, "Are you my daddy?") are really funny, enough to recommend this.  Looking forward to Keenen's spoof of horror movies, which I think is called SCREAM IF YOU KNOW WHAT I DID LAST SUMMER.$

Two if by Sea (1996)$
A blonde Sandra B. and her beau of longstanding, played by the equally blond Dennis Leary, romp their way through a romantic comedy having to do with a bunch of small-time crooks and a very valuable stolen painting. Shot in scenic Nova Scotia, the backgrounds are absolutely gorgeous, and Bullock and Leary have great rapport that makes their rocky relationship very believable. FBI agent Yaphet Koto is along for the ride in a role similar to the one he essayed in MIDNIGHT RUN. Leary co-wrote this, In a manner reminiscent of Donald Westlake -- which is a very good thing, if you know who Westlake is. If not, look him up. Leary is consistently Leary (maybe he was born a fully developed adult), while Bullock in 1996 is growing into the superstar that we know today. She's playing a role that might have been Julia Roberts' a few years before, as she did in several other pictures prior to SPEED and MISS CONGENIALITY, which she made her own.$
I am a big fan of Denis Leary, and I thought this was a damn funny movie. The plot is cut-and-dry (the little plot that exists), but it works out nicely as a comedy, mostly due to Leary's funny dialogue and humorous arguments between him and Bullock.  I think Bullock was miscast, though. She did an OK job, but her accent drifted many times.  If you like Leary, you'll probably have a great time.  I especially loved the scene where Leary was going fishing and he shoots one of the fish.  Then he cooks it up, serves it up to Bullock and she spits out a bullet.  That was classic.  But for non-Leary fans...you might not enjoy it as much.  I don't consider him an acquired taste, but his foul-mouthed banter doesn't appeal to everyone.$
The story is nothing new, the acting ain't that great, but "Two if by Sea" has its moments.  It's an entertaining little movie, and Sandra Bullock's mixture of charm, sarcasm, and innocence play out well.  The movie knows it's not too sophisticated or shrewd (even the cop says of his own investigation, "this is too easy") and it's a great film to watch on an afternoon or just to be entertained.  If you're a Sandra fan, you'll like it no matter what.  :)$
TWO IF BY SEA, in my opinion, is a charming romantic comedy about two lovers on the lam that'll make you laugh and smile from start to finish. If you ask me, Frank (Denis Leary) and Roz (Sandra Bullock) made an absolutely cute couple. I just don't understand why Frank felt he had to pull off that one last job before making amends with Roz. However, when she impersonated Homer Simpson, I laughed really hard. Someday, I'd like to go to somewhere in New England for a vacation. Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say that the production design was nice, the costumes were perfectly designed, and the performances were great. Now, in conclusion, I highly recommend this romantic comedy about two lovers on the lam that'll make you laugh and smile from start to finish to any Denis Leary or Sandra Bullock fan who hasn't seen it.$
It hit me while watching this that the movie would have been better if Sandra Bullock and Dennis Leary were not criminals.  I know, strange, as that is the whole basis for plot, but the two of them were such fun when they were bantering that I thought the plot just got in the way.  If it would have been about the two of them sneaking up to Martha's Vineyard to rekindle their romance, this would have been a truly great film.$
I avoided watching this for quite a while because I had heard it wasn't too good. But actually, I enjoyed it...enough that I have watched it twice now. I have a question the the data base cannot answer for me, though. The actor who plays the lacky to FBI agent O'Malley...he's not listed, but he has to be Dave Coulier from Full House. If anyone knows could they email me, please. Thanks$
This movie is best explained by the staff at IMdb.I thought it was funnier than s**t.The plot wasn't really important for this movie to be worth watching.I haven't seen Leary ever play a bad role or stand up &amp; I guess one would have to understand his humor,and if you do you will enjoy "Two if by Sea".If you don't like a movie,one can criticize,without such an outrage of anger.Come on!It's just the movies on a friendly database.Lighten up Mr. Wright.$
I couldn't stand but 30 minutes of this swill. Lame, utterly stupid jokes used in the most idiotic instances: third grade dialogue with a kindergarten story. Who wrote this crap? Even Sandra looked like hell, positively fat. Putrid!$
"Two if by Sea" is a little known movie, I just came across it now on tv and though I didn't expect much from the description it actually pulled me in due to the fine cinematography and scenery. I had thought that it might have been Maine, but it turns out to have been filmed in Nova Scotia. While the movie is not overly deep or serious, it is an entertaining diversion which does explore the two main characters to an extent. A relaxing watch, good for a slow afternoon. My rating: 6/10.$
Sandra Bullock and Dennis Leary are entertaining together. It takes a little getting used to their east coast accents. Once you get past that, then sit back and enjoy. It is not sophiscated thriller. Just comedic fun. Kapeto the detective is also fun to watch. The movie almost falls in the line of the Clue movie just kind of clean comedic fun the way movies used to be made. But, no way is it funny as Clue or Knives Out. I would watch again if I had nothing else better to do.$
This movie started out with some good laughs but why didn't I like it? Sandra was pretty funny but that didn't satisfy me this time. The story itself was goofy. I mean this couple was together for seven years and had nothing? Beano didn't exactly come off as a real big crime boss. I mean being the idiot of the Red Green show to king pin? I don't think so. The fishing scene was hilarious and the deer scene was great. I didn't care for Roz making a play for the rich neighbor only to run back to Frank when rich boy gets busted. The FBI, police and sheriff department were all so inept it was like the key stone cops. It had all in all some laughs but I was glad when it ended. Good enough to watch once I guess. This movie is so so.$
Two if by Sea (1996): Dir: Bill Bennett / Cast: Denis Leary, Sandra Bullock, Stephen Dillane, Yaphet Kotto, Mike Starr: One of the lamest titles in recent memory as if the writer thought it poetic that Denis Leary and Sandra Bullock break up if they did not live by a frigging beach. They play thieves who are delivering a rare expensive painting to their boss. After losing police they shack up in a deserted house. Bullock begins to question her lifestyle and is charmed by another man. Leary does everything to prove his loyalty. Director Bill Bennett does a stylish job but the screenplay would make better toilet paper. Leary makes an attempt to learn other skills that don't involve cheating, stealing and robbing but he soon must stand up for his relationship. Bullock wants out of the unlawful lifestyle yet is easily charmed by deceptive males. We hardly care about this. The ending is hardly believable and makes one wonder what was learned. Supporting roles are lousy and include Stephane Dillane as the stranger trying to court Bullock while having other plans in mind. Unfortunately those plans didn't involve kidnapping her and escorting themselves to the set of a superior film. The role is standard and predictable, and Yaphet Kotto is wasted. It is yet another boring romantic comedy retread with no real purpose other than to reflect that Bullock has done better. It is pointless fluff that should be buried at sea. Score: 2 / 10$

Bio-Dome (1996)$
Not quite as bad as people make this film out to be. There are some genuinely funny moments in this film. Sure there's lot's of silly moments and "potty-humour" jokes which may only appeal to 16 year old boys but still these lame jokes are done in such a "light-hearted-let's-not-take-ourselves-too-seriously" way which still manages to amuse and make me chuckle! There are also several cameos from actors who are now doing really well but were pretty much un-heard of back then such as a pre-fame version of "Tenacious D"!!! I'm actually quite surprised at the low user rating of 3.8 when movies like "You don't mess with the Zohan" which is possibly the worst film ever made manage to get over 5.0!!!! Bio-dome is a great "swith-off your brain" type of film which shouldn't be taken seriously at all. So crank out the beers or the bong or both and just zone into the dome!$
No one thinks that this would ever get an oscar. It's just silly, and actually makes a point about the environment if you aren't too busy getting your panties in a twist. It's 90'stastic silly. It's fun to watch and more fun to make fun of, so just chill out y'all. Not to mention it gave some young actors a chance at the big screen, so just check your pretention at the door please.$
Everyone by now is aware of the world in a bubble projects which sprung up in the nineties where they tried to recreate jungles and lakes under a glass roof in the desert right? Well thats the setting for this MTV generation comedy. No film which boasts Pauly Shore and Kylie Minogue as two of the main characters was ever going to be tasteful or deeply philosophical but hey, you don't always have to find meaning in a movie. Sometimes it's okay just to lay back with some junky snax, slurp a bladder busting gallon of soda and enjoy one of the Baldwins being an idiot for an hour and a half. Brilliant film that doesn't linger on the message (something about the environment) and still pleases on the hundred and twentieth view.$
Sure, the basic premise for this film was absolutely ludicrous, it was still good for a few laughs (and I mean a few). Based on the failed and flawed experiment of Biosphere 2 (which I have been to twice, and even got to look inside), this film proves to be the hard- hitting expose of an experiment which was flawed to begin with. Follow Pauley Shore and Stephen Baldwin as they unearth the cruel and meaningless system set inside the confines of the dark and steely Bio-Dome. What a documentary to watch! Sometimes funny, most of the time stupid, this proved to be one of the last stands for Pauley Shore.$
The single best reason for watching Bio-Dome is the sexy as hell Joey Lauren Adams (From Mallrats, Chasing Amy, SFW) dressed in possibly the sexiest white-trash-girl-next-door outfits ever committed to screen. Other reasons include; having something to annoy Kylie Minogue with if ever you meet her... she cringes at mention of this tacky masterpiece. Jack Black turns up in the background for ten seconds, yet still mentions the film at every opportunity. I can't believe that the director of "The Usual Suspects" saw Stephen Baldwin in this and gave him the job... he must have watched him elsewhere. Pauly Shore has a unsettlingly deadpan face and a unique look at humour(and, it must be said, very supple joints). For lovers of films that go nowhere, do not inform but let you realise that anything can make it on to the silver screen.$
This is a 50/50 movie, you either love it or you hate it. Funny lines are few and far between, but do exist. The rest of the film is just mindless humor that wasn't funny even for mindless humor. Great for Pauly Shore fans and for those who enjoy slapstick comedy. Otherwise the other 99.9% of the population will probably tire quickly of the lame jokes and one dimensional, almost cartoon like characters. You have to wonder why anyone thought it was a good idea to go ahead and make it. The movie ensnares the viewer by opening with a promising start. The movie quickly deteriorates from there. Stephen Baldwin only adds to the overall idiocy. As if one bad actor wasn't enough.$
One of the few movies I couldn't even watch in one sitting, I had to split it up into two. I always despised Pauly Shore, but now I really really can't stand him. There are a few moments where the jokes are relatively funny, but they are few and far between. The only neat thing about it was the overwhelming mid-90's pop culture melting pot, which appealed to my nostalgic side, but even that was squashed by the overpowering obnoxiousness of Pauly Shore. Stephen Baldwin is slightly less annoying than Shore, but not by much, and its sad, because I've seen him in other roles which he played incredibly well. I usually find at least some redeeming features in 'stoner' movies, or even like them-- (the Clerks series, Bill and Ted, etc.)-- but this movie is just really bad. The supposed protagonists are so idiotic and obnoxious that its painful to watch.$
Admittedly, the scene where Bud &amp; Doyle inhale laughing gas ala Dennis Hopper in "Blue Velvet" is the funniest spoof I've ever seen in a  movie!! All in all, this was a fun, feel good movie, and yes, Pauly Shore does get VERY annoying at times, but hey, this is all just for fun. Shakespeare it ain't, but if you're in the mood for a fun, feel-good movie to watch on a lazy weekend, check Bio-Dome out! It also delivers wonderful environmental awareness believe it or not.$
If you are in the mood to buy a DVD, I suggest you go ahead and purchase "Bio-Dome" and you will not be disappointed.  This movie is one of the best movies I own.  This great picture provides action, comedy, and drama all in 95 minutes of happiness.  The cast of this movie was very well chosen, Stephen Baldwin?s acting career skyrocketed into five star movies like Slap Shot 2.  Pauly Shore gives us wonderful advice for everyone to learn for example, "We have chippees, we have chippess, we have lots of stuff to eat." This quote is so deep and meaningful it made me go buy chips and repeat the quote 45 times.  Many lifelong lessons can be learned from viewing this movie several hundred times.  I have learned that if a person wants to help save the environment all they have to do is throw a very large party for saving the rainforests.  Also I learned that I have to be careful when I am driving and I have to drain my lizard I should make sure I am not going to be trapped in a Bio-Dome because I might have to stay there for a whole year!  Although I might sneak into a Bio-Dome just to swim in the lagoon or sleep in a storage room just like the characters of Stephen Baldwin and Pauly Shore appropriately named "Bud" and "Doyle".  Always remember the words of Bud and Doyle, "Viva los Bio-Dome!"$
Is good movie.You will see it.Stephen Baldwin and Pauya Shore are 2 idiots who get the,selves locked inside the Bio Dome for a year.There is lots of comedy and laughs,is a good time.Much funnier than junk movies such as Dr Strangelove,Monty Python,Airplane!,The Big Wazowski,and others.I liked when they released all the insects,that was funny.A must own for all families.$
Loved this move when I was younger. It still holds a punch. It is very entertaining!! Never is a let down.$
When I first come to America, nothing make the sense. One night my friend Carmine say you should watch Bio-Dome. I look all places to find this movie. I find in Goodwill in San Jose. So happy I did. Movie is brilliant. I get American bro culture almost now. Best thing is it also teach importance of love for the Gaia.$
One of the most God awful movies I've ever seen . It's about frickin' time Pauly Shore was kept from making cinematic crap after this turd ball. When this movie came out to theaters and not even seeing any previews I sensed it was going to be a stinker, since I saw most of Pauly Shore's previous movies and had yet to utter even a single laugh or chuckle. Jury Duty was only mildly amusing, Son In Law sucked,In The Army Now sucked. I enjoy stupid humor but stupid with no humor is just plain annoying, and that's what you get with a Pauly Shore movie. Now if we can just get Adam Sandler to follow suit. Stay away from this movie unless you have a death wish.$

Lawnmower Man 2: Beyond Cyberspace (1996)$
All effects, no plot, acting that puts a shame on Hollywood and makes us have to rethink this whole movie business, directing that could better be handled by a six year old, horible horrible writing, and a lame computer dork of a plot. Matt Frewer couldn't be worse as an actor. As an actor he makes a pretty good janitor. Just the Hacker's like plot alone is enough to nausiate me. This movie is so bad it rolls over and plagues the first one which was good. The only good part about this movie is using the tape as a coaster for your drink when watching something more entertaining like, infomertials.$
Talk about a disgraceful waste of film.  Sequels have a reputation for being bad and this was certainly no exception.  The original Lawnmower Man kept me entertained and had something that its sequel lacked...namely, a plot.  It was also missing the good acting, nifty special effects and everything else the original had to offer.  Can we say regression in action?  If it ever comes out on DVD you'll have a lovely decorative coaster.  Or if you want to break up with your significant other then rent this movie to watch with them..they might be gone before the opening credits finish rolling.$
I enjoyed the first film and started to watch this film but with 5 minutes of seeing they totally change a major part of the plot, I quickly checked IMDB and then just stopped watching this.$
Where to begin? The shoddy acting is a good start. Patrick Bergin is tolerable, but everyone else is seemingly doing the cue card shuffle. Matt Frewer does a Jim Carrey impression with a character that should, by all means be serious. People accuse Star Wars of wooden acting, yet this makes all the star wars films actors look like scholars. Next, on a movie that should be touted for special effects, this movie has none. When you can clearly see cardboard burning and made to look like a hallway you have a problem. Speaking of train wrecks, this film has one, and it looks terrible. There are plot holes galore as this movie's main focus is on this Cairon chip (whatever that is) which is never fully explained. Somehow the main character, Jobe, is able to coexist in both the real world and cyberspace at the same time. If anyone can find anything positive to say about this movie I would love to hear it. I will then gladly put that person into an insane asylum.$

French Twist (Gazon maudit) (1995)$
Here's a film which is definitely outside the box for American audiences. French films are usually an acquired taste and this one is no exception. This is a delightful light comedy about a married couple whose life change upon the arrival of a butch lesbian to their lives. You don't have to be a genius to guess what's coming. Nevertheless, the movie is funny, it's done with great taste and sensibility, and even though the characters are not 100% belivable, they are not stereotypical. Victoria Abril is delicious, playing the wife whose disenchantment of the married life leads her to explore a lesbian affair. What I liked in particular about this comedy, is that sexual orientation never becomes the main issue in the movie, and it's really secondary to the human relationships that develop in this bizarre triangle. The script could have been a little less linear, but the characters are well developed and well played. Overall, French twist is a fun light comedy which probably wouldn't raise an eyebrow in Europe but will need a very open minded audience in the US. Unfortunately we're not ready yet.$
This film is typical of films made outside of mainstream Hollywood studios; it takes some old themes and treats them with an attention-grabbing freshness. Playing Loli, a young housewife living in the south of France, Victoria Abril is as delightful as a spring breeze in Provence. Her husband is an incorrigible infidel; we've seen many of those in films. However, when the masculine Marijo, played poignantly by Josiane Balasko, enters their lives, the story takes many unexpected and entertaining turns which render a fairly common theme completely unpredictable. Everyone to whom I recommend this film ends up watching it numerous times and recommending it to others. The soundtrack is now one of my most-played CD's.$
The premise of this film may appear ridiculous. How could a straight woman suddenly hesitate on her sexuality when a very butch woman turns up one fine day and fall in love with her? But the premise is but an excuse for an interesting comedy, based on a classic menage a trois, but with a twist. Characters are interesting. Victoria Abril as the neglected housewife is very good. Alain Chabat as the Casanova, sleeping with anybody (at least with any woman) is superb. The scene in which his daughter visits him in his office is funny then poignant. The last scene of the film (cut from the American and British version) is unexpected. The regretted Ticky Holgado is perfect in his role as Alain Chabat colleague. As far as Josiane Balasko, who wrote the film as well as starred in it, she may not be the most convincing Butch lesbian you will find, but she wrote a good film, funny, bitter sweet, which won't leave you indifferent.$
This is one of those films where you can see each plot twist coming before the last is finished. The writers probably sat around saying "...and wouldn't it be funny if ..." and then just added another episode in this episodic picture. But it is fun, light, and doesn't try to press an ideology about human relationships on the viewer. What a relief! And the ending leaves a nice gap which the viewer can fill for himself. Perfect, to my mind. Fun fluff.$
This movie starts of with a seemingly normal 'man cheats on woman-woman gets back at man' story. But as I kept watching it, this movie kept getting crazier and crazier. I am not sure if it is supposed to be a comedy, a tragedy, or just a drama. But I decided if I take it as a dark-ish comedy it will be better received. All and all Miss Abril did very well, as well as Mr. Chabat. The only loss in skill was from Miss Balasko, who was not very believable. But it was crazy and funny in a weird way. It was nice that it was only just over an hour and a half, cause the madness probably could not have gone on too much more. It is a decent way to spend an hour and a half, but once is enough.$
very unique story with english subtitles. some titulation with the lesbian character who is attracted to loli. the pregnancy of the lesbian lover, complicates entire movie. it does still give you something to think about. the mixture of lesbian and heterosexual love and lust worked out between the three is very strange. the humor is dry and bizarre, but very entertaining. keeps your attention, dont like the addition of children involving this adult theme movie. worth renting or buying.$
Although I was hoping for something even better, this was still a generally enjoyable French comedy that I certainly would recommend.  Even though I was expecting a funnier film, I was nevertheless pleasantly surprised by how these characters (especially the homosexuals) were written.  While it's not a hilarious movie, it was still fun and definitely entertaining throughout. Plus, things are helped by great performances by Abril and Balasko. Despite a few too many slow spots, this is still a good film that is worth your time.$
This is Josie Balasko in her 'Ma Vies est un enfer' mode or wearing what some viewers will choose to call her 'vulgar' hat. A once-over-lightly of the plot will explain why. Alain Chabat and Ticky Holgado are estate agents and neither can keep it in his trousers; Holgado even makes a pass at his own daughter - he hasn't seen her since she was twelve when his wife kicked him out - and Chabat is even banging the baby sitter. Despite everything - including the one affair to which he confessed, after being found out - his wife, Victoria Abril, still loves him passionately but he is always too bushed to respond to her amorous advances. Enter writer-director Balasko as a cigar-smoking lesbian; she calls at the house in Chabat's absence to ask for water for her car's radiator, stays to fix a blocked sink - oh, you HAVE got dirty minds - and seduce Abril. Subsequently she moves in, The Dyke Who Came To Dinner if you will and this, naturally, arouses Chabat's jealousy; NOW he wants his wife. For a while they co-exist with Abril sharing her favours with both of them. Chabat is still not a happy bunny and finally Balasko tells him her price for walking away from Abril: He, Chabat, will impregnate Balasko, who, at forty, has taken to biological clock-watching. Ultimately, when she almost gives birth in the street, it is Chabat holding her hand and comforting her and turning into the doting father. If a friend saw this movie by chance and told me the outline, omitting to mention the underlying warmth of Balasko, who's about as convincing as a butch lesbian as Arnie would be as a ballerina, and the sympathetic way it deals with alternative lifestyles I'd probably have avoided it like anything by Godard but knowing Balasko's fine track record as well as that of fellow director-actor Chabat to say nothing of Ticky Holgado I snapped up the DVD and I'm glad I did.$
French Twist is a 1995 French comedy film. I like the film because I personally love comedy movie. Also, it overthrow the past concept of gender relations movie. This film contrarily emphasize more about what characters' personalities have shifted during solving problems. The sexuality parts inside the movie are showed without covering. For example, there is one scene that parents kiss passionately in front of their children. European is more open with the sexuality than American or Asian because even six-year-old-child can watch it with accompanying parents or adult guardian . Therefore, I think the fans of the genre would be satisfied since it clearly shows the relationship of heterosexual and homosexual. The structure of the film is amazing since it is really difficult to predict the plots and the ending; thus, it would attracts audience to concentrate on it. Camera angle creates the mood of the scene. In a scene when Majiro first visit Loli's house, the camera focus on Majiro's chubby body first, and move to her face last. The director wants viewers to emphasis more on her body image in order to clearly show her differences from other standard women. This film support this kind of gender condition like lesbian. I think the movie tries to tell its audience that if people love each other, it is okay to be whether heterosexual or homosexual. Since I am a Asian, I was really shock and surprised after watched this movie. It displays the relationship of lesbian boldly which is really unusual in Asian country not to mention releasing in 1995. I've never have a chance to watch this kind of gender relation's movie because most of them are restricted. Therefore, I like this film since not only scenes and shots are good but also the concepts are amazing. I think the movie might be appealing for homosexual more.$
French Twist is a French comedy film in 1995. I enjoy watching the film, and I think some of the scenes in the films are innovative compare to similar films. The film deserved some of the award such as best actor and best director since the main characters acting is vivid and entertaining. The idea of the story is interesting and deep. I think the director have a unique way to show emotions between Marijo and Loli. There is one scene when Marijo and Loli taking bath together, and this scene reveals the intense love of lesbian. Also, Laurent's emotions and attitude towards Loli is quite complex after Marijo involve in their relationship. Especially when Laurent agree to have sex with Marijo while Loli is away, I think that scene is a little exaggerated and awkward. At that moment, I feel sympathy for Marijo because no matter how much she wanted to become a man, however, physically she cannot win Laurent. It shows that man and woman are still very different in many ways. Overall, this film is trying to tell audience that love does not against sex, and love is the most powerful thing in the world. Since this film is comedy, this gender issue is also interesting. I think this type movie will appeal both to heterosexual and homosexual.$
French twist is a lighthearted comedy which centers around three characters in a love triangle not often seen in mainstream film. When it was made in 1995, this film was very controversial in America due to the nature and portrayal of sexuality in the film. However it was accepted more openly in Europe at the time. Now however the film and its subject matter, while still controversial to a point, are much more accepted in America. The characters in the film are good. Not incredibly deep but they are not two dimensional. You do feel for them and care for their feelings. And the film does a good job of having you care for each of the characters at some point or another during the film so that it is hard to pick sides and root for a single character. This film does a good job a showing the double standards between woman and men. Furthermore being a comedy it makes it easier to take in the once "edgy" and still somewhat controversial subject matter of the film. The theme throughout the film is that of love. The film tries to show that love does not depend on one's sex but rather on the people themselves. This is made clear many times through the movie. The topic of the film may seem rather heavy but the director and actors do an excellent job of keeping the movie light and comedic. There are plenty of points throughout the movie that were both surprising and rather amusing. Overall I think that the movie is definitely worth watching. It is a funny comedy and it does make you think. If you like lighthearted comedies which are outside the norm, you will enjoy this movie.$
"French Twist" is a mildly humorous situational comedy about an attractive women, wife, and mother who is married to a womanizer who becomes outraged when his wife falls in with a dyke. From there, the story turns into a series of who-has-the-upper-sexual-hand situations. The film, with more flaws than favors, is dialogue-intensive and probably not worth all the subtitle reading for those who don't speak French.$
French Twist is a light comedy movie, which raise the issue of homosexuality to spectators. The story is about that Loli was not fully satisfied with her husband, Laurent. He is work at a local estate agency, and falling out of love enthusiasm to her. Then Loli met Marijo who is a lesbian happen to visit to her house, and have a relationship. Laurent try to get back Loli, but he goes irrational way. The story is good because the characters build a relationship with each other, which is nobody, wants to expect and see. This plot is not a typical holly wood model, so audience cannot foresee the story and the do not get bored. This movie includes a lot of sexual expressions. It's prohibited for teenagers to watch the naked or sexual expression in Japan and U.S., but this movie does not hide such kind of scenes. I'm not sure if this is the general in Europe, but they seem not to hesitate. Loli is described as an emotional woman. I guess she was frustrated by Laurent's attitude for women to woman because he had thought that women generally are obey men because man feed women, and should only house work and take care of children. A decade ago this thought is also taken it for granted in Japan. Her act reflect the women's frustration in this era, and she recharged by the way indirectly.$

Friday (1995)$
When I was 14, I first saw Friday and almost choked from laughter. The script by Ice Cube and DJ Pooh is right on target with it's ghetto humor. Another plus point for the film is it doesn't stereotype. But it's Chris Tucker as Smokey who makes this film. His high pitched voice and mannerisms are classic.Hard-core rapper Ice Cube, after appearing in such hard-hitting films as Boyz 'N the Hood and Higher Learning, played his first comic role in this picture he co-wrote with frequent musical collaborator DJ Pooh. Craig (Ice Cube) manages to get fired on his day off (though he claims it's through no fault of his own) and spends the day hanging out with his buddy Smokey (Chris Tucker) and trying to avoid his father (John Witherspoon), who wants him to find another job immediately. Smokey (whose name might have something to do with his tremendous fondness for marijuana) has even more serious problems; he was given $200 worth of weed to sell by Big Worm (Faizon Love), but he ended up smoking it instead, and if he can't come up with the money by the end of the day, he'll be in a world of hurt (and will put Craig in the same place just for being his friend). And Deebo (Tom "Tiny" Lister, Jr.), a gargantuan bully who roams the neighborhood on his bicycle, has it in for Craig, while Craig tries his best just to stay out of his way. As one would expect, Friday features a strong hip-hop soundtrack, featuring tracks by such artists as Dr. Dre, Cypress Hill, Mack 10, and Funkdoobiest, as well as old-school R&amp;B selections from The Isley Brothers, Roger, and Rose Royce$
This movie is hilarious! As far as comedies go about the hood, this one is hands down the best. Chris Tucker and Ice Cube really mix up nicely in this one. This is a feel good movie and doesn't glorify the gritty hard reality violence of the inner city at all, but rather focuses on strugglin to make it with good humor and staying positive. Sure they smoke weed all up and down side to side through this movie, but you have to remember that brings a certain audience and humor to it that wasn't present before. This movie is downright laugh out loud caliber. The situations this odd couple is forced into are interesting and very funny. The re-watch value for Friday is tremendous and the characters are beautifully developed. There are some true memorable moments in Friday, and even more memorable characters. This is just a fun movie from start to finish and never tries to be perfect. Thank you for keeping it light, and to the point. All we wanted was some fun and it was delivered with Friday.$
When someone asks me which movie i have seen the most times, i have to answer Friday. I know the movie pretty much verbatim, and have seen it well over 30 times. Chris Tucker is one of the funniest people ever. This is his best performance, followed closely by Rush Hour. There are so many funny moments in this movie it would be impossible to name them all here. My favorites would have to be when Smokey meets his blind date, who turns out to be fat and bald, and the scenes where Deebo confronts Smokey and Craig, played by Ice Cube. The movie has a hilarious supporting cast, including John Witherspoon, Tiny Lister, and Bernie Mac. Critics don't know anything. If you ever have a chance to see this and enjoy urban comedy and Chris Tucker, don't even hesitate to watch. 10/10$
I am only writing this because 7.3 rating is to low for this movie and just to say that you do not have to be black or live in the "hood" to like it. Not only is it very funny movie but it has a good message with a very good cast and still holds up 23 years after it came out.$
I discovered Friday just a year ago, and since then it's one of my most favorite movies that I rewatched for about 40 times or even more. The most amazing thing about Friday is that everyone was so natural in it, so it doesn't feel like a movie - it's rather a reflection of real life. And it's still wonderful, still hilarious. All the best wishes to everyone who made Friday possible! Love you all! :)$
Really decent comedy worth watching . Has some really hilarious parts in it and just a good indie comedy. If you haven't seen, should check it out. 4/20 movie.$
this is one of those movies that i could watch over and over.... i loved it. it's basically about craig (ice cube) and smokey (chris tucker) smoking weed on a Friday when something bad happens, big worm, smokey's business man finds out he's been smoking all the weed and not selling it. Beyond that, see for yourself. i couldn't stop laughing when smokey had to go number 2, basically couldn't stop laughing through the whole movie. next Friday isn't as funny, and Friday after next is no comparison, rarely have sequels surpast their original, and this isn't one. so,relax, put on the movie, sit back, and begin to laugh. i loved this movie... 10/10$

From Dusk Till Dawn (1996)$
Although I am not AS lovestruck with this film as many other reviewers are, I did find it an entertaining albeit conscience-churning experience.  From Dusk Till Dawn really is two films in one.  The first part tells the story of the Gecko boys(Not Geico) played by George Clooney and Quentin Tarentino. They are escapees from the law and have killed over a dozen people brutally already by the time the film opens.  For me, this tale of how they kill a gas station guy and finally abduct a preacher and his two children for their RV is the most chilling part of the film.  Clooney plays a guy with little moral conscience well.  Tarentino does a good job too and you can see his wit throughout the script.  I found both men very despicable, so I guess the acting was good.  The film falls into parody/farce, however, once the the whole gang(the two Geckos and the preacher and his daughter and son)reach a strip club/bar out in the middle of nowhere in Mexico.  What happens here, to the uninformed viewer, will be totally unexpected.  Does it work?  To a degree, however, the film really loses momentum and credibility it might have had.  The acting in general is all acceptable.  Harvey Keitel once again shows us why he is such a good actor.  Juliette Lewis is also very good in her role as his daughter.  Nice to see guys like Tom Savini and Fred Williamson too.  Oh, and Salma Hayek IS the highlight of the film.$
Anyone trying to do a 'serious review' of this movie needs to lighten up. George Clooney and Quentin Tarantino are the Gecko brothers, two bad, bad men on their way to Mexico. Along the way they pick up a preacher played by Harvey Keitel and his two kids. They're supposed to meet a partner at a bar called The Titty Twister, and once they get there madness ensues. From there it takes a turn that many seem to find infuriating but I personally find highly entertaining. It's humming along like a typical Tarantino picture, and then- BOOM. Out of nowhere, it becomes all too clear that these two bad, bad men are not by a longshot the baddest in *this* bar. All of this can- and *will*, given the right attitude on the part of the viewers- read as a loving high-five to 70s zombie flicks, a homage to the campy fun of those movies. The tough guy dialog continues throughout, the gore level is astounding, and we see via Kate- the preacher's daughter, played by Juliette Lewis- that sometimes a p***ed-off virgin with a crossbow can more than hold her own. On top of that, it has a hella-cool biker-bar soundtrack and Salma Hayek in a bikini. What's not to like?$
George Clooney should have stuck will this kind of role. He did fine in Out of Sight and Ocean's Eleven, but he really dominated this movie with a fury that we may never see again. Almost every line he delivers is memorable and that is not all Tarantino's doing. The rest of the cast is dominated by cool cameos and veteran cult and mainstream names. The exception being Ernest Liu who does a good job of holding his own. No Tarantino film would be complete without a good soundtrack. This one, as with Desperado, features songs by Tito and Tarantula. Although I have only heard four songs by them, I consider them one of my favorites. I will never forget what my parents told me after they watched this without me. "You sure can pick 'em," my mother blurted with distain. Do not make my mistake, watch it with your parents to see them squirm.$
I have to say that this is actually a good movie although it does lose it's way towards the end. The final 15 minutes I thought were a little crappy. I prefer more realism in my vampires but having said that, I cannot fault Tarantino, his is perfect in the role as the twisted Richard Gecko, and although I don't usually like George Clooney he was surprisingly cool as Seth. There are some funny moments that you have to have a slightly twisted humour to appreciate (which I do!) and as long as you don't take it too seriously, it is an entertaining movie. If you like overacting, lots and lots of blood and Tarantino movies then go see.$
A terrific build up and then .... wham a 180 degree plot twist that really sucks. It's a lost opportunity with such an excellent cast. Still it is entertaining and Salma Hayek is smoking hot!!!$
Just what is the point of this film? It starts off as one film, then changes track, cheating us of a resolution to that film and ends as another movie which is nothing but a pale, pale imitation of so many other schlock-horror flicks you've ever seen. The overall impression is confusion in every respect and a great deal of hubris. Screenplay by Tarantino, direction by Rodriguez, two guys who have previously shown talent, but who now seem to believe their own hype and assume that whatever they do must be good merely because THEY did it. But it doesn't quite work that way. You're only good while you continue doing good things. There are so many questions to ask: Just what are George Clooney and Harvey Keitel doing getting involved in such pointless dreck? Clooney initially makes an intriguing bad guy  utterly ruthless and efficient  and it would have been interesting to see where that was going. But, of course, we never do. And the Clooney of the vampire film changes into a completely different character. That's not clever or witty, that's just bad, bad work. Keitel looks thoroughly ill at ease throughout, and no wonder. Did no one in the studio take a look at the script before this project was given the go-ahead? Tarantino is utterly unpleasant as a murderous sexual deviant (and why did he, as writer, assume we would find the rape, gruesome murder and butchering of an inoffensive hostage funny). On every level  except the technical  this film stinks. Avoid.$
A movie that will have you laughing at the sheer absurdity of its scenes. The corny scenes fit the tone of the film as well. Practical effects are better in some scenes than others but overall it works throughout the film. It's a nice change of pace from the first half of the film to the second. A good Halloween monster flick and has a solid Clooney performance.$

Fair Game (1995)$
I was fueling at the truck stop in Florida,chatting with the hog hauler fueling at the pump next to me. He was telling me about the time he had pulled off the road to take his 8 hour break,when a bunch of Russians pulled him out of his truck at gun point. Made him open his trailer,all the time yelling "Where are they". One had a g.p.s. locater device. He makes his way thru the hogs and stops about half way through the trailer. Stops ,reaches down through the hop crap, and picks up a cell phone. Im thinking,"Some truck drivers have nothing better to do but think up wild stories to tell his fellow truckers." Cindy Crawford,Selma Hayek,Johann Carlo, and Jenette Goldstein are hot!! ---One Truck Drivers Opinion--- erldwgstruckermovies.com$
Even though I haven't read the book, if you ask me, FAIR GAME is an excellent film that is sure to keep you on the edge of your seat from start to finish and blow you away. I said that because Kirkpatrick (William Baldwin) and Kate (Cindy Crawford) were always on the run from danger. Also, I loved Rita (Salma Hayek). I just wish her role in the movie had been bigger. In my opinion, the performances were top grade, the direction was superior, the costumes were perfectly designed, and the cast was perfectly chosen. Also, the soundtrack is really good, too. Before I wrap this up, I must warn you that this movie is very violent if you're going to see it, so viewer discretion is strongly advised. Now, in conclusion, if you like Andrew Sipes films or enjoyed Paula Gosling's title novel, I highly recommend this movie. It's sure to keep you guessing from start to finish.$
Definitely not Oscar material, but a good late night watch.  Lots of action and stunts.  Cindy Crawford can't act, but who cares!?  The plot involves some high tech Ruskies who are after Cindy, as F.B.I. Agent Billy Baldwin comes to the rescue. There is ensuing sexual tension.$
I don't why "Fair Game" got such a harsh critique. I thought the cast choices were great. Billy Baldwin playing a tough cop, and Cindy Crawford as a lawyer. This movie was action-packed, and a thrill-seeker as well. I liked the train scene when the cop and lawyer got on, and the Caddy sacrificed itself at the pole. Going after the KGB is an extreme task, especially when these agents are extreme themselves. Killing everyone in their path, targeting anyone they first lay eyes on. At first, both Kate(Crawford) and Max(Baldwin) don't get along too well. But when the rogue KGB starts targeting people, and killing Kate's sister, that's when the two began to trust one another. Some scenes remind me of "The Gauntlet" and "The Joshua Tree". The action of the movie is just right, I don't see what the big deal was. Perhaps when a model decides to go into acting, expect a lot of typecasting in the making. I don't see it that way, Cindy Crawford did fine there. I don't care what the critics say, this movie was fine, not in the theaters, but at home, it's a hit! 3 out of 5 stars!$
i actually enjoyed this film, we know cindy Crawford isn't the academy award actor, but simply this movie had an amazing ambiance to it, the Miami setting, the score of mark mancina simply amazing let's you get involved, the cinematography was good, bad script and bad plots doesn't mean the viewer doesn't enjoy the movie, it doesn't have to be that bad script makes a bad movie, these types of films are for fun, entertainment, it doesn't want to be serious more than it has to be, i recommend it for all action lovers, this is the same as Armageddon,deep impact,the specialist, these movies are for fun, not every movie has to have a strong plot.$
This was by far one of the worst films ever made. Money definitely should have been spent on some acting lessons. The plot was needing of well ANYTHING and there was no chemistry between the actors. There was a lot of things being blown up unfortunately none of them was the film itself. Cindy Crawford is of course a beautiful center piece but her acting is so strained there is no emotional connection with her acting partners or with the audience. Baldwin also bombed in having any kind of real or believable connection with his scene partners. I actually walked out of this movie because it was so painful. Some really good films would be Pierce Brosnan and Rene Russo in the "Thomas Crown Affair" or a more comical film like "True Lies"$

Kicking and Screaming (1995)$
This is simply the best "Big Chill" movie since, well, "The Big Chill." The cast is terrific; the writing is even better.  I've seen Josh Hamilton in several other films, but somehow he never has caught my eye except in this role (interestingly monnikered Grover, by the by).  What makes this film work above the usual rabble of 20-something angst films is that you genuinely understand, can relate to, and feel for the characters.  And the bits of business that have nothing to do with the "main" storyline, Grover's, are every bit as amusing and resonant.  Highlights: Eric Stoltz and Carlos Jacott's "book club."  Chris Eigeman ducking the "cookie guy." Carlos Jacott trying to remember the last "Friday the 13th" film.  Any scene involving Parker Posey.  I think I've watched this film about 10 times in completion.  The ending, I've watched about 30 times.  It's that good.  I don't think I've ever seen a more tender, memorable, perfect scene than the parting one between Hamilton and Olivia D'Abo, where she takes out her retainer, smiles shyly at him and then there's a fabulous music cue that leads us into...the unknown.  Of course, we know the ending, because Jane and Grover's fate has basically been the subject of the whole film, but the way Baumbach ties all of this together is truly inspired.  Grover's speech at the airline ticket counter may be the best monologue in the history of cinema.  Am I gushing irrationally here?  Perhaps a little.  But this film needs to be seen and recognized as the little gem (that's often better than anything else in the same genre done by a major studio/director) that it is.$
Noah Baumbach's Kicking and Screaming is one of those rare films that actually gets it right when it comes to understanding the angst of being a young adult right out of college. Baumbach's dialogue matches each of the feelings that newly graduated students go through, but doesn't stoop to the level of condescending. We all identify with the characters of Kicking and Screaming whether it is Skippy and his wanting to further his education because there might be something he missed out on or if Skippy doesn't subconsciously want to become his friends Max, Grover, or Otis. We might identify with Max who blatantly doesn't know what to do now. Max's only hellbent on not looking back on his college years, "I'm nostalgic for conversations I had yesterday. I've begun reminiscing events before they even occur. I'm reminiscing this right now. I can't go to the bar because I've already looked back on it in my memory... and I didn't have a good time." Kicking and Screaming is a film deserving to be recognize as a journey through the minds of graduates and self-discovery of oneself.$
Kicking and Screaming is easily my favorite film.  It is a funny and intelligent look at the identity crisis that follows graduation.  A brilliant script lifts the film out of gen-x romantic comedy hell.  First time director Noah Baumbach does the impossible by keeping such a talky film constantly moving.  With more insight and heart than most movies, Baumbach has created something timeless.  A must see for all who are scared about taking that next big step.$
KICKING AND SCREAMING (1995) **** Josh Hamilton, Olivia d' Abo, Chris Eigeman, Parker Posey, Eric Stoltz, Jason Wiles, Carlos Jacott, Cara Buono. To label this the perfect Generation X film so far would do an injustice to this exceptionally brilliant and dead accurate depiction of twentysomethings embarking upon The Real World and grasping futilely to remain in their comfortable existence at college.  More like an update of "Diner" with five college pals griping, searching and dealing with their recent shift of reality with some truly biting dialogue and wholly believeable sequences. Written and directed by Noah Baumbach (who has a cameo in the "cow f***er" exchange).  Perfect.$
For an "indy" film it is good, but every scene is too long. I'm sure there are a lot of people that can "get" this film, but I'm glad I do not have friends like any of these characters. The characters are very boring and intellectual, or at least they think they are, intellectual that is. If you like to pretend you're smarter than everyone else, and enjoy Kaffka references you'll love it. There is one good joke in the movie, and I'm sure it is not original to the movie but it goes: How do you make God laugh? Make a plan. By the end of the movie I was just glad it finally ended, if this was on TV I would have turned it off early.$
Armond White was right! Noah Baumbach's mother should have had him aborted! Nah, that's more than a little too harsh, but his debut film isn't very good. It shows a bit of promise, since some of the dialogue is okay here, but, overall, this is a talky, indie bore. A bunch of college students graduate but don't know where to go from there. Most of them just hang around campus, drinking and smoking and trying to bed students. The main story surrounds Josh Hamilton and his girlfriend, Olivia d'Abo, who doesn't even tell Hamilton she's going to Prague after graduation. This story is never at all compelling because Hamilton is such an unlikeable little douchebag. D'Abo probably isn't much better, but she's so attractive you can't want her to hang around Hamilton. Eric Stolz and Parker Posey are the most famous actors in the cast. Chris Eigeman has little to do but remind us how much better a director Whit Stillman is. Baumbach made a couple of other indie failures before hitting upon The Squid and the Whale. That and his subsequent two films, Margot at the Wedding and Greenberg, have been very good, so he did finally find his footing.$

"Misérables$
Remarkable...one of the greatest films of the last 50 years and easily one of the most underrated. Commitment and heart, Victor Hugo and the Normandy Invasion on a budget of under 10 million? Hollywood should learn from this...$
This film is fantastic - I hope to find a DVD of it. My husband didn't fancy it but within 10 minutes was transfixed, and it's now one of his favourite films. It requires concentration because of the different story strands (and the fact that Jean-Paul Belmondo plays different characters in different stories) but the reward is great. It does capture the polarised human aspects of those who are selfless and help others at great danger to themselves, and those who exploit or betray others for their own gain. Truly unique.$
Seldom has a well-known plot served so well as germ for a loose adaptation of the same title. The usual pitfalls of remakes and adaptations have been avoided and the result is a breathtaking picture with a wondrous mix of surreal coincidence, fantasy, fluent narration, everyday detail brilliantly highlighted and genuine pain. The tempo of this movie is fast yet never rushed. The story lends itself perfectly to the cyclic nature of Lelouche's adaptation and the actors are brilliant. How is it possible that Martines (Mrs Ziman) is not world-famous? Of all the Les Miserables made to date, in my view this is by far the best.$
I do not remember the last time I was so moved by a film. This is not an easy film to watch - simply because it is so intelligent and beautifully executed. Belmondo and Lelouch are two masters at the top of their form. I cannot recommend the film any higher. But if you are going to watch, then you have to prepare yourself to be swept away and give yourself completely to the movie as Lelouch clearly did!$
This particular film is amazing! I have read the book and consider it one of the most important works in time. The Broadway play is also amazing with its vocals, scenery and special effects. So how do you make a movie that truly captures the essence of what Victor Hugo's vision? The Liam Neeson movie falls incredibly short, but this film captures the true essence and spirit of Jean Valjean! It creatively tells you Hugo's story while telling you about another character's journey similiar to that of Valjean's! A hard-working, uneducated man offers to help a Jewish family escape the Holocaust. The Jewish family recognizes the spirit of Jean Valjean in this man and offer to tell him about Jean Valjean as they are fleeing out of harm's way. If you are looking for an interesting, unique movie to watch, THIS IS THE ONE!$
This is a truly beautiful film, remarkable for it's simple elegance in unraveling the story of it's principal characters which belies the many complex layers that lie underneath, as Hugo's original characters make their increasing presence felt as the story progresses. It would be highly advantageous to have a good grasp of the characters and plot/line of Hugo's "Les Miserables" in advance of watching the film in order to fully appreciate the universality and agelessness of the human situations which are re-encountered in this particular World War II setting. Both Hugo's novel and the film fully empathize with our universal human experience, and what are still the central concerns of our lives: pleasure &amp; pain, the love and hate present in our relationships, and at the most fundamental level, simple survival. It can leave the viewer personally identifying one moment with Jean-Valjean, and yet in the next with Fantine or Cosette, and inevitably (disturbingly), with Javert. This is an exquisite exploration and contrast of our human capacities both to bring about almost unlimited destruction, and to build life and inextinguishable hope. Very special.$
Jean Paul Belmondo plays a dual role that should have garnered him awards for his performance as both Valjean and as Henri Fortin who takes in a Jewish girl during World War II. Her parents have been taken by the German Nazis. The girl reads to Henri from Victor Hugo's classic novel, Les Miserables, since I believe Henri himself can't read. Well, he imagines himself in the role as Valjean. The film is dually impressive relating the past to the present day life of France during the French Revolution and World War II during the German occupation of France. The girl is safe in a French convent. Her parents including her French non-Jewish mother who married a French Jew succumbs to becoming prisoner. Her husband survives a shooting and is taken in by French farmers who have their own agenda. Regardless, the ending is not to be missed. It's both about the joy of living during the worst of times and how fortunate we are.$
This movie looks at the whole range of human behavior through the window of Victor Hugo's Les Miserable, transferred to two generations of people in the 20th century French setting.  Beautifully photographed, directed, acted and written, with good performances by all the actors, in parts large and small. The visual images of war, passion and humanity remain with you long after the movie ends, and its long playing time is well worth it!$
Lelouch's version of Les Miserables really isn't a retelling of the oft told story.  Instead, the Hugo story is part of the background, while we see it applied to more current times -- in this case, 20th Century France, including the German occupation.  Les Miserables keeps playing itself out in the lives of everyday people.  That is part of what makes Hugo's story so powerful, that we are there -- or perhaps it's more accurate to say Valjean, Javert, Colette, and even the Bishop are in us.$
Even if you haven't read the novel, or are familiar with it, this film is excellent in every way. Don't go into it wanting to see references to the original novel, because they are few and far between, and will only detract from your enjoyment of it. After watching it on TV, I was compelled to buy it. Les Miserables is a piece of cinema of epic proportions and quality, and I would recommend it to anyone. (It won the Golden Globe for best foreign film when it was released.)$
This movie is the truest adaptation of the book I've ever seen.  The movie is actually set during World War II, with a new plot, but one that echoes and follows the book constantly in surprising ways.  Claude Lelouche is an ideal Valjean--with the natural, powerful goodness Victor Hugo intended and none of the cloying or artificially heroic goodness Valjeans in movies often have.  Whether you've read the novel or not, this is a wonderful, emotionally wrenching movie, worth watching.$
My audience stood and applauded this film too! Those who have herein praised this film have brought nostalgic tears to my sad but smiling face... Those who wasted space and complained about this film seemed beneath my ability to even pity (at the risk of losing the message of the work: compassion!!). The great essence of Hugo's master work is perfectly represented and by moving it forward in time it somehow enters directly into our lives... in ways the novel and all the other films based on it really could not. The closest thing to this film, in my opinion, was the Broadway play (musical), because of the brilliant music, staging, acting, etc. Even so, this film touched me more than the live theater presentation did. When I tell someone how good it is and they then see it (the video mind you) they always come back with eyes bugging out and express heart pounding gratitude! A MUST SEE... sits right along with King of Hearts (Le Roi de Couer - 1968), The Great Dictator, Brazil, Kafka, Julia, Dr. Strangelove, and JFK, on my list.$
Okay, it COULD happen! A savage lion COULD put its killer instincts on hold and sit still as a wimp removes a thorn from its foot and a few years later, in the arena, that same lion COULD recognize the wimp who helped him and refuse to eat him. Call me vulnerable but I buy this. Same thing with this movie. Four people - mother, father, daughter, plus lorry driver who-is-helping-this-Jewish-family-escape-to-Switzerland-in-WW11 COULD get separated and survive ENDLESS hardships and meet up again after the war, and the Father COULD be the lawyer who defends the lorry-driver and saves him from the guillotine, and the lorry driver COULD be an illiterate who gets it into his head that he is the human incarnation of a fictional character (Jean Valjean)and that his life will follow the same pattern and he COULD become mayor of the town. Why not, it's a free country. Lelouch, of course, does chocolate-box and does it in spades, so this is always going to be easy on the eye. He also directs actors well and chooses actors who can deliver - any movie that boasts Micheline Presle AND Annie Girardot can't be all bad - and so he does here. The only way to watch this is to surrender rather than suspend your disbelief and then you will be rewarded.$
The French have been spending decades trying to deal with their complicity in the Nazi horrors of WW II. Many Vichy collaborationists went on to become high officials in the police, justice and civil administration. A few were tried and executed after the war for their role, but in fact tens of thousands of Jews were happily sent off to the concentration camps by people seeking favor with their Nazi occupiers and perhaps inherently anti-semitic anyhow, as the Dreyfus affair had long since attested. But there were decent people, too, and astoundingly 500,000 Jews in France survived, protected by nuns, priests, ordinary people of integrity and decency who refused to be animals just because they had lost their freedom. This movie tells the story of some of these people of each persuasion, as they interact in different ways with the forces around them. One of them, himself the son of a wrongly convicted man and the woman who sold herself to keep her son alive, sees himself through the pen of Victor Hugo and, in living up to his conception of Jean Valjean, transcends all the ugliness about him. It's a beautiful story, and a long road for Belmondo from Borsalino to this larger than life heroic figure. What a classic, a treasure, a never to be forgotten thrill to see this story brought to life with humor and integrity and love. Bravo Lelouch!$
Claude LeLouche does a brilliant job at incorporating Victor Hugo's novel into 20th Century WWII.  His portrayal of WWII is brilliant as well.  Jean Valjean, where are you now?  Great, outstanding, and never-to-be-outdone!$
Despite the title, this film is not a straight-up adaptation of the classic novel but a loose updating to the 20th century but with events and characters mirroring those of the book(with Henri really identifying with Jean Valjean himself). Claude Lelouch had a very ambitious and quite mammoth task to take on, and the final result is really exceptional. It may not be a straight-up adaptation, and it wasn't intended to be, but you'll be surprised and impressed by how true in spirit it is to the book. The scenery and costumes, set in WW2 20th century, are beautiful and authentic and the whole film is shot similarly beautifully. The score is sweeping, haunting and subtle depending on the mood of each scene. The story never feels rushed or stodgy even with the length instead it is ceaselessly compelling, you identify completely with every character and their increasingly intense and harrowing situation(especially with Henri's task and struggles to keep the Jewish family out of the Nazis' clutches. The ending is incredibly moving also. The dialogue is intelligent and true to period, Lelouch's direction is pitch perfect and there is no fault to be had with the acting either. In support, Annie Giradot is particularly heart-breaking but it is Jean-Paul Belmondo's outstanding lead performance that people will remember most. All in all, a really magnificent and exceptional film. 10/10 Bethany Cox$

Bed of Roses (1996)$
Lisa (Mary Stuart Masterson) is a rising businesswoman who rarely devotes herself to anything but work and more work. This is, in part, because of events that occurred during her childhood. She has a drop-in boyfriend who doesn't really spend any quality time with her but, Lisa is certain she likes it that way. That is, until the day a gorgeous bouquet of flowers is delivered to her at the office, without a card. Lisa calls friends and work colleagues to try to determine who sent her this gift. No luck. As a last resort, she goes to the florist and begs for information about the giver. She is stunned to learn that the delivery man, Lewis (Christian Slater) is her unknown fan. Lewis tells her about his interest in her and Lisa is cautious, of course. But, over the next few weeks, Lisa and Lewis become closer. Yet, something is wrong. What could it be? This is a quietly beautiful love story. Masterson is pretty and touching as the woman who doesn't know much about love and Slater is wonderful as the florist who learns to open up his heart again, too. The rest of the cast is nice and the script, costumes, sets and production values are very good. If you are drawn to stories of romance, this one should land on your must-see list. It is a bouquet of humor, heartache, and happy endings that will have you floating on air, smiling like crazy.$
I enjoyed this film, but only for two specific things: the acting of Masterson and Slater.  Masterson is startlingly good, and Slater shows a deeper range than I previously thought.  The rest of the film, though, is shallow and never fully realized.  Plot elements are thin and almost unbelievable, several of the supporting actors are terrible, the music is trite and unoriginal, the cinematography is downright boring, and the dialogue falls into inanity and predictability too often.  If not for the heroic performances of the lead couple, this film would be entirely forgettable.  Masterson, though, is truly gifted, and digs deep to find the center of her character, and Slater reaches a bit himself for a romantic side I've never seen.  I give it a 6, for the acting alone.$
Here we go, a rating from a guy....who really hates chick flicks...but sorry guys ... this movie is tops. Mary Stuart Masterson is fabulous and the perfect cast for the role. Admittedly i've had a crush on her for years but this film is meant to give that glimmer of hope to those who think they'll never find someone. Its a romance story and being an action fan find myself in somewhat uncharted waters. The plot is basic as a love story and not meant to be taken literally... Bottom line here for you guys is...if you want to impress the wife or girlfriend or make up after a fight....watch this movie together...all with be forgiven scorpio$
How can I even start. This movie is a true love story about bringing together two people so different from one another that under anything but the most unusual circumstances they would never even cross paths. And isn't that what we all want? A magic moment with someone that comes out of left field? Christian Slater is excellent as a shy but well meaning character who has nothing but the best intentions. His pain is easy to feel and his thoughts about the world are childlike, innocent, and so on target (We should all go to story hour sometime!) Mary Stuart Masterson is the picture of todays executive - hustling and bustling while never even giving thought to what she really wants deep inside. The two together are just the picture of how love should be. (The morning after scene is something I will always wish for in life and will never achieve)I honestly thought while watching this - if you could just run the credits after the morning after this would have been the perfect movie but into life a little rain must fall and so we have the second half. But even this I love because don't we all have those insecurities, that cowardice hiding deep inside?? Trust me - its worth a watch - everyone I know loves it and I have to fight to get the tape back when I loan it out!!$
This is a movie for those of you who have given up on the magic of love at first sight.  Along with a beautiful picture score, this movie wakes up the giddy teenager that is inside us all. I mean how many of us can say that we were romanced on a garden rooftop in New York City? The character Louis is so mysteriously deep, it is often impossible not to fall in love with him along with Mary Stuart Masterson. This is one of my all time favorite love stories that I like to watch to wake up my inner feelings. The original motion picture score is also among my collection of music. Very inspiring!$
I really loved this movie.  Mary Stuart Masterson and Christian Slater are great as a couple and I found myself rooting for them all the way through. Christian Slater's character, Lewis,  is sweet and sexy and leaves me wondering...does he have a brother?$
Do you know the tingle you got in your stomach when you got your 1st kiss. Well that is the feeling you get watching this movie. It is so sad but good sad and so romantic. When I watch it and i do all the time i always cry. Slater and that girl did an excellent job and they look so good together. If u like her acting rent Benny &amp; Joon (Jonny Depp is in there too) another excellent movie$
"Bed of Roses" is a light drama love story which tells of a man (Slater) who woo's a career female (Masterson) only to learn she's afraid of commitment. Yeah, it's sappy and full of Kodak moments but the two principals work well together and they can act as opposed to say, Bullock and Affleck which makes the buy-in a bit easier. Surf it, record it, and watch when you feel like a little love story with a happy ending.$
This a great movie for people who love romance. The story deals with ideas that don't usually appear in movies, but work together well. Christian Slater is HOT! This movie is very highly recommended. Sorry, no action scenes.$

Big Bully (1996)$
An elementary school nerd, plagued by insecurity and the need to fit in, lives in a nightmare at the hands of a big, fearsome bully. Nearly twenty years later, he's moved on with his life, has a son, and has made a name for himself as a successful writer. He returns home as a local celebrity to join the teaching staff, but once again encounters his old childhood nemesis who's bent on repeating the same torment despite their advanced ages. Not as bad as it sounds, with two likable, enthusiastic leads who provide some occasional laughs, but the film's dedication to juvenile slapstick grows tiresome after a while. Fans of the actors may not mind. **$
Much to my surprise, I was actually finding this to be an amusing film for the first hour or so.  I laughed more than a few times, and there was a touch of humanity that seemed to fit rather well.  Then, for no good reason, the writers tacked on a pathetic ending that left a bitter taste in my mouth.  I would even say that this was a good movie for the most part, but the STUPID showdown at the end killed all credibility that had been created. How aggravating.$
To me this is a cult classic that will remain in my favorites. It's a story about a kid David Leary who dealt with a bully fang/Roscoe who stole the moon rock I won't say why or what happens but the 2 kids sort of grow up in a way. One becomes a writer and the other remains a bit of a tough guy known as the "Big Bully" - an immature adult with great pranks. This movie was very well written in my opinion by Mark Steven Johnson; it's got some memorable quotes. Steve Minor is a genius at horror among other things which brought some nice thrills in this; it's got some wonderful actors and that lovely 90's vibe that felt so genuinely different. I just all around love this movie and I hope reviewed this decently or at least in a mediocre manor.$
I would compare this movie with such classics as Gone With The Wind. It puts a true story like Schindlers List to shame. I laughed, and I cried. I also urinated about a tablespoon from laughing. If I were to make a sequel to this classic, I would title it "Big Bully 2: Secret of the Oze." This movie has inspired me to go out and purchase an Evil Kanevil action figure. What really surprises me is the movie is based on a true story. It touched my heart like "Passion of the Christ." If Jesus was resurrected they would crucify him in this movie. Words cannot describe the natural Euphoria this movie makes me feel when I sit down to view it. Can a story get any better? Can humankind continue to create such beautiful things? Movies like this channel the human spirit onto the big screen. This movie should be dubbed as a national treasure so future generations can view the bountyful story of a tale of 2 men, who are at odds with one another, until they learn that they were meant for each other.$
Big Bully is a film filled with laughter and tears. It's the story of a man who loses his family and finds himself in the process. It's about choices, how the small decisions we make can affect us for the rest of our lives. Not for fans of Stephen King.$
BIG BULLY, in my opinion, is an excellent comedy that you will never get tired of. When David (Rick Moranis) met Fang (Tom Arnold) again for the first time in several years, I got a little scared myself. This is because of what had happened between them years before. If you ask me, the performances were good, the direction was excellent, and the cast was perfectly chosen. However, what Fang did to David, even as an adult, was very childish especially since he managed to ruin David's date with Victoria (Julianne Phillips). Now, in conclusion, I highly recommend this excellent comedy that you will never get tired of to any Rick Moranis or Tom Arnold fan who hasn't seen it. You're in for a feel good time, so go to the video store, rent it or buy it, kick back with a friend, and watch it.$
This movie is nicely done, and Tom Arnold is this really nice and lovable character who (even though he's a bully) you like a lot. A fun movie to watch anytime! Rick Moranis also plays a great character and proves once again he's a great actor.$
It had been a long time since I watched this movie, and I finally got to refresh my memory. I loved this movie ever since I was a kid, and it's still funny. Moranis and Arnold were perfect together. When David Leary was a kid, he was constantly bullied by Ross Bigger (Fang) When David and his family moves away, he tells the police that Ross stole a moon rock. Years later, David and his son return to town and David becomes the new creative writing teacher. He finds out that Ross is also a teacher at the same school and continues to bully him again. David soon realizes that he must stop running and face his demon once and for all. I highly recommend BIG BULLY!!!$
It totally baffles me how anyone can give this film 5/10, let alone 10/10. It doesn't deserve 1. What films have some people being watching? Rick Moranis and Tom Arnold should, and are obviously ashamed of being in this horrible movie, that some one mentioned, 'goes nowhere'. Tom Arnold is awful throughout, and clearly has trouble with some of the bad dialogue he gets. It is less his fault more of a fault of director Steve Miner who has done a lot, lot better films in his time. Rick Moranis is bland, and totally unfunny. In fact, was there a funny line in the entire film. The times I chuckled were the badly scripted bits, or how badly a scene was put together, or how awkward Arnold was looking. Okay, okay, some would say this is a children's film but it's message is totally confused. Bully reconciles with the bullied - well, I doubt most kids would ever want to see those that bullied them again, let alone get re-bullied by them in adulthood. The film would simply depress kids. Overall, an awful movie. Bad script, bad direction and bad acting. Suffice to say, I give this 1/10.$
Rick Moranis used to be a popular star but it was probably with this film that he suddenly wandered into "where is he now" status. Tom Arnold is his costar in this part one of his horrible starring vehicles trilogy (which would later consist of "Carpool" and "The Stupids"). The really silly and not as funny as it might sound plot has to do with grown man Moranis moving back to his old hometown and still being intimidated by his old grade school nemesis (Arnold). Seeing these two grown men act like children throughout the film is more stupid than funny and what could have been an interesting premise if there was more comedic power in the script sudddenly turns into a huge mess.$
I saw this movie and there was no reality to what a bully is really like or how his target is affected (except when it was affecting Davie with his job and life, check out the workplace, it happens) until the end when Davie says "I still have nightmares from 4th grade because of what you had done to me" to Roscoe, his childhood bully. Adult bullies do not go the route of "the polar bear is dead" chant. They play divide and conquer among colleagues and not "flicking peas" in a lunchroom. Much more sophisticated (and psychopathic) as adults. However, I also felt that this was made as a take on bullying or as a satire more or less? If so, not a good idea. Bullies grow up to be your rapists, spousal abusers and child abusers. There is no humor in that at all. Frankly, it is time to call a spade a spade and see that bullying is not silly kids stuff like we were suppose to think by this movie. It is a serious problem with serious consequences and not something I take lightly.$

Screamers (1995)$
For the few who happen to be fans of Peter Weller, this is certainly one to hang onto. A great little film that is just as brutal and vicious as any movie by Paul Verhoeven. I was surprised Verhoeven didn't direct a film like this. A little cheesy, but often times interesting, Screamers  is a little film I like quite a bit. The funny thing is, I liked this film, even though I had watched Twelve Monkeys just a couple hours earlier (I did a little theater hopping). A cool little film with a freaky ending.$
One of the very best Philip K. Dick adaptations, SCREAMERS relates the tale of a war between two groups on a barren planet that is complicated by a batch of killer robots that are beginning to replicate themselves to resemble humans. Dick's best stories often dealt with identity confusion (think TOTALL RECALL and BLADE RUNNER), and SCREAMERS fall squarely into that category as no one knows who to trust anymore. One of the more subversive scenes has an army of screamers in disguise as young boys being shot down by the "good" guys. Peter Weller of ROBOCOP fame stars, and he was at the top of his game when he made this. The only thing holding this picture back is the budget, which must have been minuscule. But the plot is dealt with in an imaginative way, somewhat along the lines of BODY SNATCHERS or John Carpenter's version of THE THING. Highly recommended.$
Obviously most people didn't think this movie to be much anything special, although I tend to disagree. I thought this movie was probably one of the best sci-fi films in years that I've seen. Peter Weller (best known as RoboCop) is also a very under-rated actor who deserves some good roles these days. The only problem with this movie was the very poorly done special fx. I'm sure if this movie would have been given a bigger budget it would have done better in theaters.$
Screamers might not be a high quality science fiction movie but for a 1995 production with a not that big of a budget it isn't bad at all. It has some issues, that's for sure, but it kept me entertained for the whole duration of the movie so I'm not going to complain about those minor futile details. The story is futuristic, and sometimes funny as you see they still use a walkman in the future, at least that's how they thought the future would look like in 1995. There is constant suspense because of the screaming creatures, there's enough action to keep you alert, the acting isn't the greatest (at least not award winning) but certainly not the worst either. All in all for a sci-fi movie from that time it isn't bad.$
Under rated, scary, yes, even creepy. I LIKE IT! I rented the DVD years ago, and look to buy it for my collection... to put next to my soldier and starship troopers dvds, no less. Petter Weller carried the movie. No doubt about it. The whiny, phsycologically scarred soldier from the NEBs was far better tolerated than Mr "Game over man!" from Aliens (bill paxton at  his unusual worst). This movie deserved a better budget, but was well made within what they had. Yes, I see the static back drops... a far cry from the dynamic CG animated ones we have grown used to in recent films. However, the "Outer Limits" style of cinematogrophy worked well for me. Okay, everyone just getting up and dusting themselves off after launching a mini-nuke into their kid-infested base was unrealistic and could have been portrayed better. The David screamer caught me off guard from the beginning, I didn't suspect anything until he was shot. And the chick? classic move. The teady bear at the end was UBER CREEPY... and begs for a WELL DONE sequel... with Peter Weller... or else don't even try. Mark this as one of my favorite unsung movies. A must see for the SCI-FI afficianado.$
Woah... I saw it in 1996 in a theater near my small Provençal village, and i simply wasn't expecting that... Christian Duguay proved once again he was terribly underrated by both the press and the public, "Screamers" ("Planète Hurlante" in France i/e "Screaming Planet", nice title too...) is the B-side at its best, the B-efficiency with an almost-A script. The cast is OK (Roy Dupuis was almost a star here in the early 90s, the VFX impressive (for the most of them), and - as some viewers wrote earlier - the first part very promising. Overall, a good job. Take it on video with a couple of friends, some chips'n'soda (ok, beer if ya want).$
Set in the distance future and in a place far far away, Screamers is an excellent sci-fi flick about two warring entities whom both have been long since forgotten. For the past 10 years, Sirius 6B has been shaped by the face of nuclear war and now it will be shaped by a another, more smarter, and aggressive entity called a Screamer. A Screamer was a man-made robot (sent to help one side) complete with an advanced A.I. who lurks beneath the ground waiting for its prey. Waiting silently and patiently. But little do both sides know that this man-made robot has got a few tricks up its own sleeve. Screamers is a amazing movie that features lots of suspense, plot turns, and a few good comedy scenes of its own. If you enjoyed Pitch Black or Red Planet, this is a great movie to add to your collection.$
Seen it years ago when it came out to rent and again this year on DVD, it is a good film but still in the straight to video bunch of films, some FX are really good for such a film and some are not so hot but it has been done to the best of there budget which has not been much, any weak parts are made up by a good story one i would like to have seen run another 20 mins or more as it seems to end just as its getting in full swing, this is all down to budget mind, if the film had more money, bit more gritty. bit more spent on FX, better lighting, more depth on story, then who knows this could of been a very very good film to push other films such as ALIEN and others, but as it is 7 out of 10$

Nico Icon (1995)$
A fascinating look at a sad &amp; mysterious woman whose music was a deep, dark gaze into the pit of existence. If you have never heard Nico, then by all means, you must see this film. Fans will love it regardless, but the uninitiated have the most to gain. The facts of her life are chronicled, but numerous attempts by friends &amp; acquaintances to describe who Nico was are fruitless. One realizes by the end of the film that Nico was so elusive, much like her music, that attempts to describe who she was tend to reveal more about the speaker, than they do about Nico. Someone says that Nico, who had been a model first, always hated being complimented on her beauty. The speaker suggests that it must have been some German perversity. He then explains how she proceeded to continually attempt to make herself ugly. Another person says "No one loved Nico &amp; Nico loved no one" - a haunting statement that points to the isolation that Nico experienced. When she was beautiful, she was adored, so she destroyed heself &amp; watched (&amp; cried beautiful melodies) as everyone in her life capitulated. One of the finest scenes in the film finds Nico's Aunt looking over pictures &amp; press clippings of the girl she helped raise. She speaks of Nico in adoring terms, referring to her as a princess. We then see her listening to Nico &amp; The Velvets, gazing into the sky, lightly singing along, then shedding tears. It is a striking scene, as a tight &amp; proper, matronly German figure crosses the boundary to an underground youth culture, that is so divorced from her world, yet bridged by her love for Nico. A great documentary of a performer who was well ahead of her time.$
i can see how anyone who doesn't already enjoy nico wouldn't enjoy this film, but i thought it was great. i was first introduced to nico via her work with the velvet underground, and while nico herself isn't a very sympathetic "character" her life was extraordinarily interesting. i didn't think the filmmaker tried to her make her more lovable than she was, but instead tried to portray her as she was; interesting as well as cold, shallow but artistic. what made her unique and fascinating also made her a poor mother and an isolated individual, but her voice was different as was what she had to say. if you have an interest in her music and her work with andy warhol's factory, then i think this is a movie you'll enjoy.$
This is one of the best documentaries I've seen so far. The weird but mesmerizing horror &amp; occasional beauty of Nico's life &amp; music are extremely well evoked. The most impressive scenes are the interviews with Alain Delon's mother Edith Boulogne -- who died soon after the movie was finished -- who had taken care of Alain's &amp; Nico's son Ari, and, finally, John Cale performing "Frozen Warnings" alone on the piano. Susanne Ofteringer's film includes interview footage with James Young, the former keyboarder of her band, who has himself written a book about his time with Nico &amp; the band. Only Alain Delon is missing ... No matter if you know or like Nico's definitely genuine, but strange approach to music, the movie is worthwhile watching for its documentary qualities.$
this film is truly anything but a real documentary.  How anyone could take as interesting a subject as Nico and so incomprehensively make a film that purports to go inside her life is beyond me?  It seems like this film was thrown together at best.  I had no understanding of the real chronology of Nico's life, as the timeline jumps around repeatedly.  The interviews seem largely to rely on one interview with John Cale, and it's just quite clear that the filmmakers didn't do any research whatsoever.  Instead the filmmaker's come up with the dull technique of using superimposed titles throughout the film to highlight the un-insightful interviews.  So superficial, so dull-looking, so without any kind of understanding of what must go into a posthumous documentary that it is really sad.  A wasted opportunity.  Shooting photographs for an hour or so and playing the Velvet Underground and Nico album over it is hardly the stuff of insightful or talented documentaries.$
In my former comment I wrote that this "docu" is nice. Well, now I have more insight into the topic of Nico and I must post another comment, since this documentary is no documentary at all! First of all, from the technical aspect: The "narration" jumps around in time without any proper explanation, there are important video clips ("i'm not saying" and "evening of light") that *every* nico fan will want to see at full lenght and that are of course *not* played at full lenght, and the visual design, especially in the part when only v.u. music is played in the background and the lyrics are on the screen with some background images of a cemetery, is completey ridiculous and sometimes you have the feelings was only done to add time consuming footage. And now to the documentated facts: This "documentation" is no documentation at all, nearly everything said is a lie!! Here are the facts: Nico was a highly talented singer/songwriter/actress, that released three solo albums from 1969-1974, then continued her career as actress in the movies made by her longtime partner Phillipe Garell in the seventies, and continued her musical career in the 80s with two solo albums (where one ("drama of exile") was released in two versions) and lots of live albums from her world tour that spanned over 1200 live performances in japan, australia, europe. She had a unique style and a unique appearance. At the beginning of her career, when she was not writing her songs yet, she once sang for the group "the velvet underground" to gain experience in the music bussiness and that was it. she didn't like the band nor the music they played. And now, the maker of this pile of trash called "nico icon" wants to give us the illusion that Nico was unsuccessfull, insane, nothing but a junkie, ugly, a freak and the only good thing she made was that album with the velvet underground . . . At the beginning, her former manager from the 80s is asked about her and tells us how sick she was and that she was a freak. He of course doesn't tell us that he was deeply in love with her, but that she didn't want him and he then completely snapped and started things like running on stage during her performances and shouting "you are the devil!" (all documented in the book "songs they never play on the radio") There is a live performance clip shown that shows Nicos unique performing style that is misinterpreted as a proof of her being a freak, altough it is clearly obvious to anybody watching that she is a wonderful performer, even if she looks a little bit tired in the clip (which is no wonder if you have watched the FULL length of the video (it is available on a dvd called "nico: underground experience + heroine") and see there that she performs in a bar where it is extremely hot and she is very sweaty and tired because of this). Then we see an interview with James Young, who once played keyboard for her and now wants to make the most money out of this and  you have the feeling that he will tell any lie for money. He wants to make us believe how ugly and unhealthy Nico wasn't (although you just have to look at a picture of her to know how beautiful she was...). The rest of the documentary is only bla bla about her being oh so much addicted to drugs and being oh so strange, and that is was such a shame that she didn't want to be a blonde model anymore bla bla bla, but nothing about her *unique* music, her acting, her vision of art etc. If you believe the docu, Nico didn't do anything else except taking drugs. Quite the opposite it the truth: She was a busy performer and busy writing songs and releasing albums, she had her own strict priniciples and believes. Susanne Oftertinger didn't even care to dig out Nicos last film performance, altough it was in a german film that should be easy to find!! Every fan of Nico watching this docu will be angry about this unnecessary lies, and everybody who doesn't know her will think her as a freak (as the movie obviously wants to). Believe me this is just like if you make a documentary about Romy Schneider for example and tell there that she was a cheap bad actress. Ok so the best thing is to watch this extremely bad researched movie (did Oftertinger do any research herself at all? For example: In the list of Nicos albums once appearing in the movie and as extra on the DVD, the "drama of exile" album and it's making is *never* mentioned!! Oftertinger doesn't seem to know *anything* about Nico, just the lies people like Young and her manager like to tell) without sound, so that you at least can see some pictures of the beautiful Nico. But it gets worse: The German DVD version is edited, there are the clips from the Garrel movies missing (maybe he forbid them to have clips from his movies in there after he saw what lies they tell about his beloved Nico) and some beautiful still-pictures. Of course the two music video clips are not included as extra on the dvd, I mean *as if* they would be interesting to Nico fans... SO: AVOID IT!!! DON'T BELIEVE IT!!$
As a big fan of this Artist I was very interested what this documentation will tell me about her. I didn't tell much. If you don't know anything about her before you see this film, you will get no real info at all about her and a distorted impression about her. The interviews are nice, but are missing background info. I only detested James Young who calls her a "failure". Much time is wasted which odd images which texts from her songs over them. Why is the music video for "Evening of light" or "I'm not saying" not played in full length? For a real fan this would be very interesting. This docu also has no real chronological order, but just jumbles around with no connection. Important facts (especially about her death, her last concert, her last movie, her music, her albums) aren't told. Important people don't show up in this movie, like Antoine Giacomoni. Why is Nicos album "Drama of Exile" totally ignored in this Docu. What about her alleged Mafia connections? etc etc etc. Sure, the cuts from interviews with her are very interesting, but this docu is still very sloppy.$
As a long- and real-time fan of Nico's music, and one who was lucky enough to see her perform around 1980, I was delighted when I heard a documentary had been made about her, and was riveted to the (TV) screen throughout when I finally got the chance to see it. Nevertheless, I think the movie put entirely too much emphasis on her drug use/abuse. I would have preferred to learn much more about the making of her music and perspectives on it by musicians and critics as opposed to endless, dreary testimony about the depth of her involvement with smack. This is shabby treatment, and the worst of it comes near the beginning, like an initial slap in the face, complete with a low blow by James Young, who calls her a "failure" - perhaps he was thinking of his own musical career. He seems ignorant of how powerfully and magically she could - and still can - speak straight to the soul, in a voice at once detached and spellbinding. Jackson Browne and John Cale stand in welcome and sharp contrast in their thoughtful reminiscences about her and her work, and the opus at least closes gracefully with a moving performance of her "Frozen Warnings" on the piano by the latter. A must-see for all with any liking for her music, but will probably only put off those not yet acquainted. - J. Koetting$

"Crossing Guard$
This film should have been good.  It has a potentially great plot, and the first few scenes are very good.  Then, it simply falls apart, and the main plot is basically ignored for much of the remainder of the movie.  I also found the ending to be somewhat disappointing, although it was nice to see the focus back on the central storyline.  The acting was certainly good, as you would expect in a Jack Nicholson movie, but the real tragedy is that David Morse was absolutely wasted.  He was outstanding, but he rarely had anything to work with.  What a disappointment.$
Wonderfully talented actors, and a director I imagine talented as well. But both the actor's indulgence and the director indulging them is stultifying. Seemingly left to their own devices they create scenes with few sparks and much tedium. Nicholson, Morse, Huston and the other have ability to burn, yet they fizzle with false restraint.The actors are obviously improvising in many scenes yet their behavior often seems contrived and illogical. The director, attempts to create a reality of life with ancillary actors surrounding the leading characters,yet those scenes within scenes seem forced and intrusive. One should care about the three major characters caught up in a truly tragic event, yet it's generally "ho-hum" because they are caught "acting" in most every scene. With such great talents, this film was truly disappointing.$
Sean Penn wrote, co-produced and directed this strong drama about a conflicted Los Angeles businessman intent on nailing the drunk driver who killed his daughter. In the lead, Jack Nicholson is appropriately somber, displaying no over-the-top theatrics as he visits the parolee just sprung from jail, giving him three days of freedom before his death. Sub-plots detract from the main narrative, with Robin Wright a colorless love-interest for convict David Morse and Anjelica Huston lost in a confusingly-written role as Nicholson's ex-wife. Frequent trips to the local strip club muddy the focus of the piece, however the emotional showdown between the two men is wisely examined, heartfelt and exceptionally well-acted. **1/2 from ****$
When "The Crossing Guard" came out, it seemed like we'd heard for years that Sean Penn was worthless and just got in a bunch of fights. We turned out to be wrong. He's as great a director as an actor. The movie casts Jack Nicholson as Freddy Gale, out to get drunk driver John Booth (David Morse), who accidentally killed his daughter. Over the course of the movie, we see how Freddy's life is damaged not only by his daughter's death, but how he has never talked to anyone about this. Moreover, Freddy has never gone to his daughter's grave, but John has. Everything comes to a head at the end. Maybe I wouldn't call this the ultimate masterpiece, but it is worth seeing. Also starring Anjelica Huston, Robin Wright Penn and Piper Laurie.$
Pathetic, disjointed and slow. Written and directed by Sean Penn, this film's focus is on Freddy Gale(Jack Nicholson), who's daughter was killed by a drunk driver. Gale mistakenly thinks the best thing for the family is abandon them and vow to murder the guy who did it. Gale is a shady jeweler that has turned himself into a whore-mongering drunk. And growing is his obsession with John Booth(David Morse), the driver that killed his little girl. Booth finishes doing time for the crime and moves into the basement of his parent's home. Freddy Gale is in countdown mode to commit murder...murder Booth. My favorite scene is Gale and Booth playing cat and mouse on a city bus...Booth running for his life and Gale with gun in hand. Also in the cast are: Anjelica Huston, Piper Laurie, Robbie Robertson and Robin Wright Penn.$
Sean Penn is obviously as talented a director and writer as he is an actor. This is a powerful film, if a little too self-consciously "artistic" in parts and unnecessarily dense in others.  Wonderful acting and a great story of how obsession and a need for revenge hurts the avenger the most. Jack Nicholson is fabulous as an angry man who has lost the ability to feel anything but hate.$
Unfortunately some fine acting by Jack Nicholson is badly wasted due to a script that stretches credibility to the extreme. The first problem is the numerous t&amp;a scenes that do nothing to enhance anything other than Jack Nicholson's ego. Second, there are scenes that are totally unbelievable, and the ending seems nothing more than audience manipulation. Third, there is very little character development other than Jack Nicholson, and Angelica Huston's part should have had far more importance. Fourth, the title "The Crossing Guard" is way off base, giving no hint that the main theme of the film is redemption, and forgiveness. Not recommended. - MERK$

"Juror$
I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and am at a total loss as to why it scored such a low vote. I guess these days a movie just can't be a big hit unless it has lots of fancy special effects and sex scenes. 'The Juror' has a strong, easy to follow plot and some really great acting; Alec Baldwin's role was terrifyingly real! I'm no fan of Demi Moore, but she played her part very well. And the kid that played her son was equally great -- I remember him from the TV series 'Third Rock from the Sun' and always liked him. To anyone thinking of renting this flick, I say pay no attention to the naysayers and go for it!$
This movie is enough to recommend on the strength of the acting from Moore, Gandolfini, and especially Alec Baldwin but it is a shame that some of the excesses and superfluousness (especially the unsatisfying escapade in Guatemala) could not have been cut out. Instead of more action it would have been interesting if the ethical aspect of a compromised juror (albeit unwillingly) could have been explored in the spirit of 12 Angry Men. Anyway, this movie still rates a 7/10 on the strength of some undeniable suspense and very strong acting especially from Baldwin.$
"The Juror" is a well paced suspenseful film,with great performances from the two main actors, Alec Baldwin,and Demi Moore.the supporting cast includes Anne Heche,James Gandolfini and a young Joseph Gordon-Levitt.Demi Moore Plays Annie Laird,mother to Oliver,(Levitt)and also a juror juror in a high profile murder case against a mob leader.Annie is forced by a mob associate to convince the other jurors to render a verdict of non-guilty or her son or others she cares for will be harmed.the problem is,the jury is convinced of the guilt of the mobster and the evidence seems to indicate guilt.I won't say any more about the plot.i will say that what follows is loads of suspense and nail biting tension.Demi Moore is so convincing as the mother who feels helpless and Alec Baldwin is Brilliant as her tormentor.the movie doesn't end the way i thought it would(and i mean that in a good way)instead offering up a few twists i wasn't expecting right up until the final moments.A terrificly entertaining film,which relies (very successfully) on suspense and great performances. 8/10$
I really like this movie - it is a 90's thriller, not smash 'em up or shoot 'em up. A good plot. Relatively good performances from the cast - it held my attention. I miss thrillers like this.$
"The Juror" is largely a conventional thriller, and it's also too protracted (113 minutes) for its one-note story, but it's professionally done, and elevated by a very good cast. As the villain, Alec Baldwin gets to chew the scenery at times, but at other moments he gives his role an almost disturbing complexity; when he tells Demi's character that he loves her, despite the monstrous things he has done, you believe him. A deglamorized Demi Moore is convincing, and then we have James Gandolfini as Baldwin's family-man associate, Anne Heche as Moore's best friend, Tony Lo Bianco as a Mafia boss, and others in smaller parts. They make this otherwise predictable studio product worth seeing. **1/2 out of 4.$
I am not a big Demi Moore fan and seeing this movie wasn't top priority but afterwards I was very pleased with the outcome.  This is, by far, Demi Moore's best film to date as she shows so much emotion as a single mother stuck in a difficult position between working for the mafia in order to save her family and herself.  Moore truly deserved an Academy Award nomination if not a win, and the Razzies were very out of line by giving her Worst Actress for this (it was moreso for "Striptease" and that also wasn't that bad...a thing about the Razzies, they don't know what the hell they're talking about half the time).  Alec Baldwin is pretty good as the villain and Anne Heche gives all she has as the token best friend.  Ted Tally's ("Silence of the Lambs") script is riveting and keeps you on the edge of your seat.  A great suspense film with a great performance by Demi Moore...see it and believe it. 8/10$
Demi Moore gives a sullen performance as an artist and single mom who is harassed by mobsters while serving jury-duty on murder trial involving Mafia Godfather. Overwritten, inconsistent film attempts to outweigh its campier aspects with mind-thriller clichés (such as Alec Baldwin's role as a egomaniacal hit-man) but results are still closer to "Murder, She Wrote" than to anything resembling Tom Clancy. Would probably pass muster as your basic, dumb time-waster were it not for a ridiculous climax in Guatemala. Moore is grim throughout, and Baldwin (pursing his modulated lips and narrowing his eyes) is a poser here--not an actor. Anne Heche does what she can with a best-friend role and there are a few rousing scenes, but the off-kilter script buries the good points, giving way to a pushy, unpleasant and occasionally offensive movie. ** from ****$
This film had a great cast and a tried and tested format of a juror forced to get a mafioso acquitted so nothing will happen to her son. Right from the getgo though, I could tell this was poorly done. There were so many plot holes and inconsistencies that ruined any semblance the movie had of being a thriller. I thought the movie was going to be a courtroom drama but the movie continued long after the acquittal (which again was done so unconvincingly). The movie then began to meander with all these small sub-plots between Baldwin, Moore, the mafia guy, Anne Heche etc. Fifteen minutes before the movie ended I gave up, nothing was making any sense and this was so disjointed and unbelievable that I had no interest to find out what happened. Maybe, this needs a second viewing, but I doubt it as its hardly high brow stuff. In any case, this isn't a courtroom drama and its far too lightweight to be a mafia movie. Its an unsuspenseful, poorly written film that I wasted an hour and three quarters on.$
"The Juror" features Alec Baldwin in yet another edgy criminal role not unlike his character in "Miami Blues", which happens to be terrific, while "The Juror" is close to terrible. Everything about the trial is very vague, stretched, and uninteresting. The characters are mostly unlikable, including Demi Moore. So what you get is a highly unlikely story of a meek artist juror submitting to Baldwin's threats for almost the entire film, and then suddenly transforming into "Mrs Rambo" for the unbelievably weak finale. Throw in a ridiculous "how did he do that?" relating to the demise of Tony LoBianco, some questionable motivation, and a general feeling of "no way could that happen". - MERK$
Despite a fairly good cast, this film has nothing to offer. Nothing we haven't seen before. Nothing we haven't seen done better. Nothing worth spending time watching in order to gain. The plot is decent at best, and barely holds up at all. The conflict is just not there; who are we supposed to hope dies? Who are we expected to root against? Baldwin's character is the villain that has the most screen-time whilst remaining unlikable, but he doesn't seem like he's the actual villain. The pacing is pitifully bad. The acting is poor, apart from the leads. The characters are all stereotypes and paper-thin ones at that. The film manages to cram in every single cliché in the genre in. The ending is as predictable as they come. The film never manages to build any real suspense or tension, making the film seem endlessly long and pointless(when, really, it's just two hours long and pointless). There's just nothing new here, and nothing that makes the film even remotely worth experiencing. You like the plot outlines? Check out the book. I'll wager it's better. I can't imagine that it's worse. You like the idea of the film? See if you can't find a better one. It shouldn't be too hard. It must be easier than finding a worse one. I recommend this only to very big fans of Demi Moore, James Gandolfini, Alec Baldwin and/or Anne Heche, and possibly huge fans of the genre. Everyone else should just skip this one. 5/10$

"White Balloon$
Abbas Kiarostami wrote this film, which is very much like his 1987 masterpiece, Where Is the Friend's Home? That film had a young boy trying to give back some other boy's homework that he accidentally took home. This one has a little girl having all kinds of problems trying to buy a goldfish on New Year's Eve. Each of these children have to navigate their way through a world of adults in a culture where the young are to be seen, but not heard. The earlier film is quite a bit better than The White Balloon, but this is a wonderful film in its own right. It has a wonderful set piece where a street performer thinks that the girl is donating the money she has for her goldfish to a snake charmer. She has to work up the courage to speak up for herself, and then to take the money when it has been wrapped around a snake. My only real problem with the film was the lead performance, by Aida Mohammadkhani. She has really nice facial expressions, but her voice and line delivery are monotonous; truth be told, she gets kind of obnoxious after a while. Mohsen Kalifi, who plays her older brother, is wonderful, on the other hand. I really liked the way the sibling relationship was developed. Kiarostami, genius that he is, adds some small details that give the film a much deeper resonance than one might find at first glance (I'd almost call this a trademark of his). The sequence with the titular balloon, along with the haunting final shot, is the kind of thing that could make this film last forever inside of me.$
This movie, as has been said before, enters the world of children. But it does it with such a lack of full credit for grace and feeling. It never belittles children - in fact, it makes adults look like the buffoons they are. You feel for every victory and defeat they have and get engrossed in their plots and problems. The encounters with common Iranians is also wonderful, especially the soldier at the end. Perhaps the most natural example of child acting is shown through Rezayeh - I am surprised she was never nominated for anything in this film. Her other films are also great, but nothing matches "The White Balloon" Not to be missed - one of the best Iranian films of all time, without question.$
It was my big sister's turn to pick a film to go to when we were gorging ourselves in what the Reykjavik cinema festival had to offer back in the days. Didn't expect anything but mushy boredom for an hour and a half. Instead of the sentimental torture I had braced myself for, I became spellbound by this beautiful story that totally held me captivated right from the beginning to the end. The little girl, Aida who plays the protagonist, was ever so sincere and true in her role that you forgot you were watching a film, and even I felt a couple of masculine tears running down my cheeks. The White Balloon is simply a gorgeous film and it's out of the blue quirky humor elevates it even further. Even with the wet towel slap in the end, I truly loved the whole of this Persian confect buffet down to it's last bit, ... and still do!$
I had the pleasure of watching this movie last year. I have recommended it to countless others since. There is something about this movie that stays with you and is absolutely unforgettable. I can't quite put my finger on it. The pace is slow and purposeful. The little girl and her brother are adorable. The minor characters are fantastic, including the tailor and the difficult customer. I found myself laughing out loud several times during the movie, The themes are universal. It was very easy to forget it took place in a different country in another language. It is all familiar and at the same time, revolutionary. I can watch this over and over. It may be a perfect film.$
I recently viewed this movie on Bravo TV and was absolutely spellbound.  At first, the Farsi language threw me, but it was delightful after awhile in a melodic sort of way.  Plus, the lead character is adorable.  Her traumatic experience in buying the goldfish is heartrending and at the same time is enlightening.  You will want to turn away for fear that she will not succeed and yet you watch because you know that she will.  The movie also helps you to regain a faith in the common goodness of the human race.$
I just finished watching this delightful movie about a five-year old Iranian girl who is given money to buy a goldfish but loses it. The film, innocent yet interesting and enthralling takes the viewer along on her journey to find the money so that she can get her fish. She encounters many people along the way, all who try to help her to get back the money. There are many underlying themes throughout the movie as well, but above all, we learn to help each other and see each other as more than just strangers. Also, the plot summary given about this film is misleading and downright false. No one tries to take advantage of this little girl at all!$
I just watched this film, and after reading all the comments about it, I'm frustrated overall. Like one of the previous comments said. This movie is all about metaphors. That is the most obvious things about Iranian film. To have anyone say that this movie had no point and that the title made no sense is annoying. There are several things to be taken from this movie. First of all it is a realistic glimpse of Iranian daily life. Its not pretty and scenic as in other Iranian films. There were so many people who were concerned about their own needs over the girl's money, who by the way was a complete brat. However you should take note that despite their incompentence or lack of concern for the girl, each attempted to help her out, albeit often grudgingly. It is important to understand why the Afghani boy was freezed upon. This could be a class/cultural/social issue. First of all these middle class children were ungrateful and ran off as soon as they got their money. 2nd, the tensions between Afghani and Iranians have been notable as you can probably see in films such as Baran. 3rd this is about the human nature of looking out for yourself over everything else. Once the children got what they wanted, everything else doesn't matter. The white balloon was the only balloon not purchased. It was alone in the end just like the Afghani boy.$
This Iranian film was one I found listed in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, it was selected as an entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the Oscars, but was not accepted as a nominee, I hoped it would be worthwhile. Basically in Teheran, it is the eve of the Iranian New Year, seven-year-old Razieh (Aida Mohammadkhani) has seen a goldfish in a shop and begins nagging her hurrying Mother (Fereshteh Sadr Orfani) to buy it for the festivities instead of the skinny ones in her family's pond at home. On their way home, the mother and daughter pass a crowd of men gathered to watch two snake charmers, Razieh wants to see what is happening, but her mother pulls her away. Back home, Razieh is upset her mother is refusing to let her a new goldfish but continues her campaign of nagging. Her older brother Ali (Mohsen Kalifi) returns from a shopping errand for their father, he is unseen, but his presence causes tension in the family, he complains that we asked for shampoo, not soap. When Ali returns with the shampoo, Razieh enlists his help in changing her mother's mind about the goldfish, bribing him with a balloon, insisting she can buy it for 100 tomans. Razieh finally gets her wish, her mother gives her the family's last 500-toman banknote and asks her to bring back the change, she sets off with an empty glass jar to the fish shop a few blocks away. On the way, Razieh stops to watch the snake charmers, one of them takes the banknote from her to wrap around a snake, tempting her to grab it back, but they eventually give it back to her, seeing that she is getting upset. Then while running to the shop, she stops outside a cake shop for a moment, she reaches the shop selling goldfish, but then she realises she has lost her money. An Old Woman (Anna Bourkowska) takes pity on Razieh and helps her to retrace her steps and find the banknote, it is found in a grate that leads to the basement of a shop. After the old woman leaves, the money has fallen into the grate and the basement of the shop, which is closed for the New Year celebration. Ali comes along, as his sister has been gone for some time, together they try to find a way to retrieve the money and receive help from many people, including the Tailor shop owner (Mohammad Bakhtiari) next door and an Iranian soldier (Mohammad Shahani). The money is just out of reach, but the fish shop owner promises he will try not to sell the fat white and orange goldfish until the little girl returns. Finally, the siblings receive help from a young Afghan street vendor (Aliasghar Samadi) selling balloons, he carries his balloons on a wooden stick, he has a white one left. The group attach a piece of chewing gum to the end of his stick, and with it, reach down into the basement through the grate and pull the money out. In the end, Ali and Razieh run off to buy the goldfish, leaving the balloon seller sitting alone on the grate, the siblings pass him and are happy to finally have the fish, and the change, and the boy walks away with his white balloon. Also starring Hamidreza Tahery as Reza and Asghar Barzegar as the Pet Shop Manager. It is a very simple story, a journey of discovery for a little girl desperate to buy a goldfish, and her desperate attempts to get the money back to buy it, Mohammadkhani is cute, and her insights make the ordinary seem miraculous, it is slow and annoying in parts, but overall it is a delightful drama. Good!$
Don't know about you but thirty minutes of watching and listening to an eight year old girl pout, whine and be on the verge of tears 'cause she can't keep her goddamn goldfish dough from being taken away was not my idea of a compelling cinematic experience. Consequently, I pulled the plug (or drained the fish tank, whichever metaphor you prefer).$

Things to Do in Denver When You're Dead (1995)$
Things To Do In Denver When You're Dead is a crackling, explosively verbose, darkly comic 90's neo noir. In other words, right up my crime infested alley. It operates on a heightened plane of larger than life thugs, Machiavellian crime bosses and an almost beat poetry by way of Shakespeare writing style, courtesy of Scott Rosenberg's pen. The writing is one of the best quality's of this film, and when you watch it and find out what buckwheats and boat drinks are, you'll get it. Andy Garcia turns on the slick as Jimmy The Saint, an ex mobster on the path to enlightenment, attempting to open his own business, called Afterlife Advice, where dying people record pearls of wisdom for their loved ones to see after they're gone. He is called back into action for a job by his old employer, a creepy, all powerful gangster known only as The Man With The Plan, who is played by, you guessed it... Christopher Walken. He is a a perverted, unsettling ghoul in the role, paralysed from the neck down and confined to a blow tube operated wheelchair, lurking in his dimly lit, Gothic mansion and hurling threatening orders like Max Schreck from Nosferatu. He coaxes Jimmy into pulling his old crew together for one last job, a personal one involving Walken's even creepier son. Of course the job goes horrendously wrong, resulting in Walken's wrath raining down upon each and every one of Jimmy's crew, as they all scramble, most of the, unsuccessfully to escape Denver. It's a stark, largely unpleasant bit of violent fun with a snappy vernacular all its own, but don't mistake my review as making out as pure darkness, without a heartbeat. There's an incredibly romantic core, as Jimmy falls in love with two vastly different, beautiful girls at once: an angelic socialite from the other side of the tracks named Dagney, played by the ever gorgeous Gabrielle Anwar, and Lucinda, a scuzzy, spunky hooker with a heart of gold played with twitchy, heartfelt energy by Fairuza Balk. Jimmy's crew is a pockmarked landscape of rough and tumble character actors, all with their own distinct flavour. William Forsythe is aces as Big Bear Franchise, a family man thug, Christopher Lloyd displays warmth and feeling as Pieces, the veteran of the crew, Bill Nunn is great as Easy Wind, and Treat Williams comes out of left field as Critical Bill, a nickname reminiscent of the condition he puts people in, as he's an absolute live wire lunatic, who literally uses corpses at the morgue he works at for punching bags, because his shrink told him he needs an outlet for his rage. Yeah. Steve Buscemi has a sly role as dangerous hit-man named Mr. Shhhhh, because he barely says a word. There's also great work from Jack Warden, Bill Cobbs, Don Cheadle and Glenn Plummer. I have to reiterate again what a lovely script it has, like a particular lingo all its own, that the characters wear like a verbal glove, and share with you with every interaction they have. It's an extremely overlooked bit of hard boiled fun, with just the right touches of scary, shocking violence, world weary golden age regret, with a stable full of wild, wacky characters to keep you more than entertained. Check it out.$
This is an excellent film that has interesting characters, a tricky plot line and alot of cool phrases/sayings.  This is a movie critizied for copying Pulp Fiction, but it's not the same kind of movie.  It's script was made before Pulp Fiction and is more complex then Pulp fiction.  Steve Buscemi is a standout in the cast as a deadly hitman named Mr. Shh, and also noticeable is Treat Williams who is the psychotic Critical Bill.  This is a totally original film that should be recognized and talked about, it only had bad timing on it's release.$
Next to Garcia's work in INTERNAL AFFAIRS, this is really one of his best performances... It's a rich film on every level, and it's too bad the film was caught -- back in 1995 -- in the backlash of Tarantino madness.  Scott Rosenberg has a unique voice as a writer, and this film attempts to create its own reality.  All those who say they 'hate' this film should rent their copy of HAPPY GILMORE and keep their opinions to themselves.  Needless to say, this is a film that provokes and p***es people off and one which should be viewed without conventional expectations...$
Following the success of "Reservoir Dogs" (1992) and "Pulp Fiction" (1994), there were a slew of quirky (and violent) crime films. Most of them were pretty awful ("2 Days in the Valley" "Lucky Number Slevin") and some that were pretty excellent ("Get Shorty" "Grosse Pointe Blank" "Go"). "Things to Do in Denver When You're Dead" falls somewhere in between. The film was written by Scott Rosenberg, who's written solid entertainment like "Con Air" and "Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle" to duds like "Kangaroo Jack" and the "Gone in Sixty Seconds" remake. The script on it's own probably falls into the the lesser half of Tarantino knock-offs, but an excellent cast (Andy García, Christopher Lloyd, Treat Williams, Bill Nunn, Jack Warden, Steve Buscemi, Christopher Walken, Fairuza Balk, Gabrielle Anwar, Bill Cobbs, Glenn Plummer, Don Cheadle, and Tiny Lister) greatly elevate the material. The story follows Jimmy the Saint (Garcia) as he puts together a disparate crew of quirky criminals (i.e.Lloyd has appendages falling off and Williams uses bodies at the funeral parlor he works at as as punching bags) on a job that, as you'd expect, goes all wrong. The film does have it's moments. Williams and Nunn cursing each other out in a Resturant while birthday-hat-wearing children look on in stunned silence is pretty funny. Williams as the unpredictable and off kilter Critical Bill is probably the best part of the film. A close second is a doomed romance between Garcia and Anwar. However, the film's script is really just trying too hark in it's attempt to be cool and quirky. The narration by the great Jack Warden seemed particularly pretentious. Overall, there are better films to choose from if you're wanting 90s style Tarantino rip-offs, but if you like the cast here (which I do greatly), you'll probably enjoy "Things to Do in Denver When You're Dead."$
Gary Fleder's film 'Things to do in Denver when you're Dead' is a slick, stylised and violent thriller, complete with a very pretty girl (Gabrielle Anwar) and a seriously cool title. It's mindless entertainment, in some ways not so dissimilar from the later 'Ocean's Eleven' (in which star Andy Garcia also appeared), although rather darker in tone. In fact, the mixture of crime caper and tragedy doesn't completely work, it's hard to really care about the characters when they play it straight, while it's not 100 per cent sheer fun either. In it's defence, it's definitely one notch up from the average gangster movie in terms of originality and style; but only the one.$
6.8??? Are you kidding me,this is iconic movie 10/10 i watched this movie a hundred times and is never boring.$
This is a good movie. What is a good movie then? It is entertaining and has a good story line and is acted out and directed well so that you don't have to do a thing but sit back and let this movie pull you into its world. It doesn't fail on that pull either. You will be introduced to thoughts and ideas in the underworld that are only known by those thugs that hang out there. Of course, these are men and women with a soul too and that is what comes across. Sure, they are on the wrong side of the tracks, but think for a moment that "there go I but for the grace of god" and you will be alright watching them go through their daily messed up lives...There are some stand-out performances and I would say that all actors give them. When it is their turn to act and convince us, they do. This is entertainment. The title throws you off, but after seeing the movie, you make allowances for it. One last thing. If you like malts, you know ice cream malts, well, have a pitcher ready when you watch this film. It is no fun to drink alone....enjoy$

Antonia's Line (Antonia) (1995)$
This is a wonderful movie that shows how one woman and the people around her find happiness while rejecting the roles that society would force on them. There are good men such as farmer Bas and Simon, and perhaps even the priest in the end. This movie is not primarily about them however. It is about Antonia and her line of descendents: Danielle, Therese and Sarah. By rejecting stereotypes about the mentally ill, gay or other marginalized groups and accepting everyone for what they are, this family was able to find happiness in the face of hardship. Despite the despair of crooked finger, they prove that life is worth living. It is a complex movie. In the word of one of Therese's suitors, life is an intersection of relationships. The many relationships portrayed in this movie, most loving, some not, are what give it life and give the lives of these characters its meaning. I am a male and opponent of excessive political correctness. I was not offended in the least by this movie. The characters in it are wonderful. They happen to be mainly women, which is a refreshing change in a world where so often the female characters are only there as props for the male stars. I give it fourteen thumbs up!$
I have to disagree with those who claim that this film is ULTRA feminist. Though Marleen Gorris' feminism is indeed apparent is indisputable.  But people who are not necessarily part of the feminist movement will still appreciate this film.  It is a more modern view of the independent woman, but I didn't see the political agenda of Gorris overpowering the film. It can be enjoyed as a simple "fairy-tale" (as declared by Gorris herself). The portrayal of women as independent and strong is definitely refreshing, but  those who claim this film makes a statement against religion and family aren't necessarily accurate.  the film covers these issues, showing women's strength in dealing with religious hypocrites and single motherhood, but I personally didn't feel the film was encouraging all women to leave the church or raise up families independently.  It's a marvelous story of women's strengths and vulnerabilities, and the love that the women in one family share.  ALL people will enjoy this film.$
No character development, characters passed through town self-righteously and gave into impulses. Characters merely made pronouncements: "I will have a child but no husband", "he is bad", and "she is good". "I want to be an artist" and she's off to art school with no worry about the farm or the costs of school and supplies. It was a romance novel in which Holland wasn't affected by WWII and serious farming involved strolling and tossing seeds from a wicker basket while the sun sets gently behind the horizon. All men are either sinister or simpletons and all are useless. Why would a story that purports to show strong women first need to geld all the males? It is never a sign of a strong women/man to need to diminish your counterpart.$
One of the first things that reminded me of Marleen Gorris's film is that its reminiscent of "Cinema Paradiso" as we watch these characters in this town over the span of about 50 years. This story has a woman named Antonia (Willeke Van Ammelrooy) who along with her daughter Danielle (Els Dottermans) come back to her Dutch village after the war to bury her dead mother. After that she stays and along the course of time different people come to live with them as it becomes a sort of commune run by Antonia. A retarded woman is getting raped and Danielle stabs the rapist with a pitchfork and the woman comes to live with them. As Danielle gets older she decides to get pregnant and Antonia takes her to the city to shop for the proper donor. One of the local farmers comes to court Antonia and asks her hand in marriage but she says no, but she also says he can do chores and once a week they will get together for sex. Danielle's daughter becomes a child genius and her teacher gives her extra lessons. Danielle and the teacher become lesbian lovers and form a strong relationship. The film has some truly dark moments like two rapes being depicted and one to a young girl. Gorris does an admiral job of letting the viewer get to know each character. This is not a 3 hour epic but when the film ends you have gotten to know every character pretty well. While we see Antonia and Danielle go to church, this film seems to relish the idea of getting together with people and exchanging ideas and thoughts. Antonia genuinely loves people and being around them at all times. Her spirit is evident from the first moment she appears on screen. As the film continues on we witness Antonia handing down her spirit to her daughter, then to her granddaughter, then to her great granddaughter. It even passes on to the other characters that come to live with her. The make-up is superb and towards the end of the film we see Antonia when she was younger and then a second later as she is as an 80 year old woman. Its a very good job and you don't notice the big change until that scene pops up. Good editing gives this film a nice flow to it and its beautifully lyrical. The film gives off a good sense of nostalgia and Gorris is definitely a very good storyteller.$
"Antonia's Line", winner of an Academy Award for Best Foreign Picture, explores themes of time, place, and memory with a light touch and an abundance of warmth. It's tender treatment of family and community registers affectionately in the viewer's hearts. The film opens in medium close-up of an elderly woman(Antonia) accepting her dying fate with dignity and quiet resignation, and then dissolves fluidly into a flashback of Antonia and her free-spirited daughter Daniele returning to the rural town of their ancestry. The picturesque village fondly recalls the odd townsquare of Federico Fellini's "Amarcord", complete with it's eccentric inhabitants. The villa boasts a howling woman named Madona: an overzealous priest(Who leaves the church because 'he can't reconcile his enjoyment of life with the churches' enjoyment of death'); a cynical intellectual named "Crooked Finger" who steadfastly quotes from Shopenaur; and a dim-witted young man with the unbecoming sobriquet "Looney Lips" to name just a few. "Antonia's Line", written and directed by Marleen Gorris("Mrs. Dalloway") celebrates the infinite possibility of life. The film, withstanding it's take on the afterlife("This is the only dance we dance") luxuriates in it's glowing affirmation of the present and the past. The main setting is the outdoors dinner table, where family and extended family measure their vision of life with laughter and temperance. Gorris views humanity as 'an intersection of perspectives', and some of the movie's best moments come from these subtle exchanges during dinner. "Antonia's Line" is filled with clever, fantastical imaginings, (Possible spoiler) from the loquacious grandmother rising abruptly in her coffin, to a well-aimed wing extending from an angelic statue. Throughout the film one sees more fanciful evidence and privately senses the director's fascination with the subversive filmmaking style of Louis Bunuel and his surreal mischievousness. (Possibile spoiler) Similar elements of fantasy pervade the film's final frames where the decease venture back and witness Antonia dancing joyously with her partner;a  scene reminiscent of the finale in Fellini's "8 "1/2". Gorris then cuts seamlessly to the present(Antonia-aged greatly- dancing the same dance) where the film began. "Antonia's Line" ends in great insight with the lines: 'As this long tale comes to it's conclusion, nothing has come to an end. Something always remains,.........so life begins, without knowing where it came from or why it exists, because it wants to live'. The film's immodest achievements mark this as a major work from an ambitious and intriguing filmmaker.   Kurt$
This film is a beautiful presentation of European feminism, which, unlike its American counterpart, is about exploring and celebrating femininity rather than just kicking men in the balls. It is also a film that, judging by the other user comments, appeals to men just as strongly as to women. Literary, beautifully filmed and emotionally gripping, "Antonia's Line" is (pardon the cliche) a film unlike any other.$
I think the other viewer got it wrong when they said the movie suggested "who needs men?". This movie contains every kind of relationship combination imaginable-- the message was anybody can find love. People also have children under all sorts of circumstances in this movie. The characters are in a family like relationship to each other because in a lot of cases they don't fit in with their family or the norm. Not to mention it explores the relationship of a woman with her family--- her mother, her daughter and her granddaughter. This movie explores religion and atheism, namely the hypocrisy of religion and the emptiness and search for meaning when one doesn't have religion. This movie explores a lot of themes- love, life, death, good vs. evil, and meaning. If all a person got out of it was that it was anti-family and anti-religion and anti-male, then they have lived a pretty sheltered life and won't get "it" anyway.$
This is one of my favorite movies that I've seen so far. This movie is excellent, you can see how time goes, how people can change over time. Time goes and people get older, time goes and people die. It reminds me of Antonia's great-granddaughter when she was telling about her great-grandmother's (Antonia) life and it was about her youth, about the people she met, about her old age, about her daughter, her granddaughter and finally her great-granddaughter, it means the narrator. It's amazing and gripping. This movie was really getting interesting as time went on in Antonia's line, we are all getting older over time, this movie is basically about time, so it made me think about this film as the greatest film that tells about it. it won an academy award for best film, it was certainly well deserved.$
Perhaps Antonia and her pink house unveiled for us the simplicity of the answer of those questions: 'what is life? Why are we here? What's my path? Where I belong? What's beneath and beyond? Could the whole learning and knowledge in this world help us to go through this life? And the answer is so simple and so beautiful drew in this impeccable movie. The answer is not just love, unconditional love, but accepting. Accepting suddenly became the ultimate form of love. The scenes come one after the other, like paintings, time is flying and you feel its wings, the world dies and reborn with every day, technology takes place of the old things, churches become empty, people die, children are born, the fields get green and brown, but above all the table from the garden will be always full with people, because there, at the pink house, some people discovered that the miracle of life is life itself, is love and is acceptance.$

Once Upon a Time... When We Were Colored (1995)$
"Once Upon a Time When We Were Colored" (1996): Set in the deep American South, over the years 1946-1962, and told as biography, this is the story of one boy's memories of being raised in the Cotton &amp; Bible Belt. He's poor, his family is in pieces, he's Black, he's surrounded by the KKKand yet, this is a soft, even soft-focus look back at the people who DID provide community family, did not dwell on their poverty nor make their race the focal point of a normal day. We are so accustomed to angry, relentlessly violent films about the racial divides, this film could easily be taken as a Hallmark Card presentationbut SOMETHING about it tells me otherwise. Yes, problems are depicted, and yes, the times they were a-changin', but not as fast or dramatically as we've come to accept from the quick flip of a few pages in history class. I LIKE the pace of this film. It's slow, warm, often funny, occasionally sugary, sometimes sad or maddening, but for the most part it's a nostalgic look back at the GOOD parts of black author's childhood.$
The author's stated intention was to show the family that nourished him and protected him from the world of hatred and segregation. The film showed just enough of the segregated life to let the viewer know that Cliff needed to be protected from that world and nurtured to overcome the scars that outside world could inflict. I think Taulbert and the movie did a good job of showing how the love of his immediate and extended family could compensate in some way for the hatred and oppression of the outside world. I hate to see the movie berated for not being a documentary of all the hateful excesses of the segregated South when that was not the movie's intent. We have films that are considered classics that are about different parts of World War II, and they don't document all the atrocities of the Holocaust. Not focusing on parts of an era that are not the main point of the film is not "sugarcoating." It's an excellent film about growing up in a loving family and overcoming challenges through the love and support of others. It's fine the way it is.$
"Once Upon a Time... When We Were Colored" is a nice movie. It's tame, calm, and largely uneventful which makes it nothing more than nice. It's about a Black boy's growing up in the South during the Jim Crow era. It's devoid of any real drama considering we're talking about Black folks trying to survive in the South. The movie has some fine actors in it and I believe they did the best they could with the script. Unfortunately, it was a weak script. I think this movie would've done well as a book, but not all books need to be made into movies.$
I kept waiting for the bad moments to happen, as so often they do in these reminiscent movies of growing up in the south, yet no real drama occurred. These were moments pieced together, and if that was the intent--it worked. True, a child's reflection of childhood would be pieces of memory chained loosely together, impressions of events, people, and times. However, when the movie ended I thought, "That's it?" There were fine performances; however, the plot seemed to soft-step around the real issues, such as the Jim Crow laws, segregated schooling, subservient wages, and escaping to the north to avoid the subjugation. We got breadth, when depth might have made a much more interesting plot line.$
It just touchdown little things that happened in the era didn't really stick to any things. And when it came to the very ending they could have delved into that a little more but they didn't. One thing that irritates me the most is that the lead character has a pretty terrible mother and it wasn't acknowledged in any way if this is a true story I wonder how he feels about the end result which sadly he probably like because it was an All-Star cast$

Angels and Insects (1995)$
One of the most intricate, well-made films I've seen.  The acting is tremendous, the imagery is subtle yet stunning.  A film which makes one think of the intricacies of human relationships.  The pilgrimage of the hero from the brutal Amazon to "civilized" society which he finds to be anything but civilized in spite of the gorgeous trappings of the upper aristocracy. Highly recommended!$
"Angels and Insects" is a slow starter with several strikes against it from the outset. First, the title is a turn-off (from the Byatt book of the same name). Secondly it's a period piece (circa mid 19th century England). Thirdly it factors in Darwinism, Amazon natives, ants and insects, and other esoteric subjects which don't make films appealing to the masses. Finally it has none of the usual Hollywood tinsel and trappings. Those, however, who can get past all that will find a masterpiece of filming, acting, directing, writing, costuming, orchestration, etc. A slowly captivating and somewhat melancholy story of the goings-on within an English manor, "A&amp;I" delivers powerful drama, sterling performances, and masterful execution by the auteur. A great watch for those who love cinema for cinema's sake.$
Angels and Insects is one of the most visually stunning movies I have ever seen but every bit of the immense beauty &amp; luxury that is on the screen contributes to the sense &amp; definition of exquisite excess that is so ingrained in the Alabasters' way of life. If one imagines this movie as a 1940s Hollywood effort, perhaps starring Olivier &amp; Fontaine, ala Rebecca, then one must really appreciate the subtly shaded performances. I have never seen better acting onscreen, especially in the performances of Rylance &amp; Thomas. And all the interplay of idea &amp; emotion, science &amp; passion, objectivity &amp; subjectivity, so rarely transferable from print to film are so brilliantly achieved here. Hey, even the sex scenes are among the best I've ever viewed.$
I find this movie absolutely fascinating on all levels: basic idea, story, acting, imagery, set design, colors, music. It all fits together so well and tells a fascinating, rather sad story of beings, their limits and the way they deal with it in a time period of great changes and discoveries. Set entirely on a beautiful Neo Gothic country estate and its grounds, the plot evolves like a dream. The main character looks amazingly like Abraham Lincoln (the story is set during that president's lifetime but presumably in England). He is a man of reason and science - and of no means. He arrives as a kept intellectual and falls for the beautiful daughter of his benefactor. The attraction is exclusively erotic (the movie can be credited for some explicit sex scenes which are for once not gratuitous but as necessary as they are believable) and rather unexpectedly he finds himself adopted into the family and a permanent resident of Dreamland. Always of an alert disposition he observes - and is in turn observed and manipulated. Dreamland finally turns out to be a nightmare, the true nature of things small and not so small are revealed. The Odyssey continues.$
A U.S.-British co-production for PBS, from A.S. Byatt's story "Morpho Eugenia" (a better title!), this head-scratcher of a human drama involves a Victorian England bug-specialist who comes to stay with a wealthy family and falls in love with his benefactor's lovely but unstable daughter. A carefully plotted picture, which might mean slow or sluggish--yet the film is never boring. Moments of eccentricity, romance and surrealism are blended together with skill, and the actresses in particular (Kristen Scott Thomas and the wonderfully brave Patsy Kensit) are first-rate. It's a difficult film, but one worth staying with. **1/2 from ****$
This compulsion in analysis built the modern world. "You know nothing" rather he's saying, "Stop learning." Rylance is a channel in goodness, also how he survives dangerous tribal societies is the way how journalists hide; always allowing himself shielding to look in harmless non-judgment. Whereas his true thoughts we can intone through our own. 'Seeing as audience.' See also how he brings the whole family into his studies, meaning, enlightenment awareness is contagious. He is a prophet bringing our context to them. "Observing the unknown world by the hand." He endlessly seeks from his vacancy into a full immersion. Even so much as an asexual becoming sexual; the adventure becomes wholly explored as if another scientific checklist. "How fascinating I've loved, had children, been betrayed and lost everything, anyway shall we be off then?" Does he even care about anything but bugs? Even after its shocking twist, his feeling is great relief in freedom for the 'next adventure' AKA he was already seeking reasons to leave. Humanity we know is predictable. Bugs are surprising. What about his sheer selfishness? "Have we not been good to you?" "Yes, but..." Of course he is a non-entity. See how he's in awe of the other's abilities in art, which the film brings as the divine missing piece of him. Art and science here are cousins with a mutual respect; coping as neither reflect the material 'actuality.' An insect in a human's body. Ants and socialism unlocks the piece as an abuse of the agreement between the 'haves and have nots.' And then, Film always brings about renewal--it's either nature or art. Both here. But I also see an urgent and restless revolution across it for its gentleness. The framing and beautiful shots I've read to be vicious sarcasm against its subjects aimless luxury (even the mother's death was strangely gluttonous) rather I see it lazy and graceful, sparing its characters judgment with both pity and affection; as in, these are just symptoms not the cause. But still it all must be expunged. One review calls it, 'a postmodern period piece,' which might be my absolute favorite thing.$
This movie presents a brilliant stage worthy level of acting to the screen. I was stunned by the quality and subtlety of the performances especially the lead and Kristin Thomas. The story is almost painfully slow but that helps create a mood and sexual tension that works perfectly. I was literally on the edge of my seat both with the drama of the characters and just wanting to be closer to their nuanced performances. Jeremy Kemp as the elder Lord of the manor Sir Harald Alabaster displays aristocratic intelligence rarely found in films. The dinner table discussions of the emergence of the radical new approaches to evolution and culture surrounding Darwin's revelations are compelling. Also the role of Edgar, representing the boorish son who clings to the old ways of class hierarchy is finely wrought. Highly recommended. A thoughtful film.$
An intelligent and unusual drama, based on a short story by A.S. Byatt. In mid 18th century England, a penniless naturalist who has lost his prized specimens from the Amazon in a shipwreck (I think the movie meant him to be a young Charles Darwin, though an incident where specimens were lost in a shipwreck happened to his colleague Alfred Russell Wallace) gets a job cataloging specimens held by the Alabaster family in their country estate. He will eventually marry their daughter Eugenia (Patsy Kensit), despite the fierce opposition of her brother Edgar. Not long after having children with her, he will discover a terrible secret haunting the family. A cousin of the Alabasters, the bookish Matty (Kristin Scott Thomas) will turn out to be his only friend and ally. At times the movie looks like a strange cross between a film by James Ivory and a film by Peter Greenaway, with the Alabaster women carrying bright colored clothes that suggests different sort of insects. Even if you don't take the entomology references throughout comparing insects with humans very seriously, they are nonetheless fun. And the denouement is terrific.$
Glossy costume drama that is inert for two thirds of the movie.  A lot of this has to do with Mark Rylance speaking so softly and hesitantly that one wants to tell him to get on with it.  But the main problem is that Patsy Kensit is way over her head with this one.  The only time I thought she was really acting was when she panicked when she was getting covered with moths (and methinks that she was really panicking).  Also, Kristin Scott Thomas' Matty, instead of coming across as a champion of liberated women everywhere was merely reduced to a know-it-all that I tired of pretty quickly.  The film's only saving grace was the references to insects, which was rather interesting.  Other than that, a rather boring historical picture with some shocking subject matter to make it relevant.$
Kristin Scott Thomas gives an Oscar worthy performance full of nuances and subtleness in tune with a by gone Victorian era when nothing is outrightly spoken but always hinted at so unlike our lurid confessional age. Thomas can infuse a scene with a multiplicity of meaning through a movement of the wrist or a tilt of a head and trounces Emma Thompson's lauded performance of British reserve in "Remains of the Day". To appreciate this film you need an artist eye, others who dislike it would be better off getting whacked with a sledgehammer.$
Angels and Insects is a thoughtful adult tale predicated on an anagram of the word "Insect." It benefits from a provocative story, interesting collection of characters, the charm of a period setting, and several philosophical and social musings, all worthy of consideration. The casting is generally admirable, as is the carefully selected country house setting. Unfortunately, all of this is brought to ruin by Philip Haas' inept directing. Haas is unable to elicit a single convincing reading from any of his characters, each one single dimensional and unsympathetic. Haas does not believe his audience capable of following the subtle story, so every symbol set in florescence, every theme overstated and restated ad nauseam, every moment of foreshadowing underlined and forced. This heavy handed approach is exacerbated by Paul Brown's ridiculously overwrought costumes, which try frantically to convey the image of humans as insects. Worst of all, Alexander Balanescu contributes a genuinely ugly and distracting musical score, which could ruin a far better film. For example, in an early scene when Adamson returns to Britain and is feted at a private ball, instead of using authentic music to nail the period effect and introduce all the elegant and subtle feelings that run beneath the Victorian surface, Balanescu concocts a drone that is an explicit imitation of locusts. This scene, which could be such a foil to the dance in the Amazon that precedes it, is utterly dreadful. If it is artistically useful to scream that humans and bugs are the same, Haas' approach might have worked. For the viewer who prefers to construct his own meanings and contexts, he will deplore that something intelligent has been debased to middle school stupidity. Perhaps those who admired "The Piano" (another film that frantically worried the view would not Get The Message, constantly harassed by garbage music) would also like this film. This viewer regretted that a marvelous story, worthy of a master filmmaker's hand, was wasted, as it is unlikely that anyone will ever attempt a remake. Pity.$
As someone who usually keeps abreast of Antonia Byatt's work, this novel somehow escaped me and I saw the film first instead of the other way around this time.  In the case of this film, Kristin Scott Thomas (a brilliant actress) was the draw.  The film started out innocently enough with the ennuyes riches, the surly siblings, the whispering servants and the gentile (clueless) visitor.  However, the secret, once revealed (and quite graphically, I might add) made me go vertical in my seat!  Quel choc! REALLY a must-see!$

White Squall (1996)$
With masterpieces like Alien, Blade Runner and the underrated, but superb, 1492: Conquest of Paradise, I am quite a big Ridley Scott fan. White Squall is something of a let down in comparison, but it certainly deserved more than a measly $10 million US gross at the box office. As you would expect from a Scott film it boasts his trademark lavish production quality and stunning photography. The sequences at sea at some of the most spectacular ever filmed as Scott revels in the rolling waves and lurching ship, convey the ferociousness at sea, even in fairly calm conditions like no other film I can recall. The story however is less successful and is essentially (and unusually unoriginal for a Scott movie) a Dead Poets' Society at sea, as a motley crew of young boys, played by a talented and convincing set youngsters, do a lot of growing during the course of the voyage under the watchful eye of an Ahab-esque but eventually sympathetic Jeff Bridges. The final scene most definitely resembles that of Dead Poets' Society. (Captain. My Captain). However the film as a whole never bores and makes for compulsive viewing at times particularly the superb storm of the title, that is both moving as well technical tour de force.$
I love this film, it about a bunch of boys who either get sent on this ship to get disciplined by their parents or some just choose to escape their lives, They take it for granted tho, they don't realise how much hard work it will be. The ship and their captain take them on a journey, a journey that will probably change their lives forever, facing their fears and coming to grips with their lives, they learn a lot and pull together as a team. A truly moving story and another great film by Ridley Scott. From struggles to strengths, this is an inspiring film to watch with many good actors, Jeff bridges is really good for this role playing a tough, wise teacher for the boys. I love this as it is based on a true story, it makes it even more moving.$
I quite agree that it is a Dead Poets Society set at sea. It is a mistake to classify it as an Action Movie. It's about building trust and group reliance with some action scenes. The development of mutual respect between the boys is quite believable The acting is excellent in all cases. As a Jeff Bridges fan, I was surprised I'd never heard of it before it appeared on late night TV. The last looks exchanged between the captain and his wife are about as good as they get. Not a really great movie but I found it well worthwhile as a non-fan of action movies.$
For at least 3 years I picked up this film at our local video store - and passed it up, groaning to myself that I was not interested in seeing a family style flick about a group of adolescents. Getting desperate to find a video one evening, I decided to take a chance. My wife and I really did enjoy this movie! Good solid acting, acceptable script, and an interesting story that happens to be true.   If you are so addicted to the usual action or sex film, then maybe you will not like this film. But if you can appreciate good wholesome qualities, then this flick should be tried. The suspense is quite good - better than I expected, and the special effects are excellent.$
I am sure many people who rated this poorly would rate "Bad Boys" a phenomenal work of art. This movie, if watched with more than just an eye for special effects, tells the story of people finding themselves and becoming a family of sorts. The world in which we live has far too little depth of character. Yes the movie was condensed in a few parts but unless you intended it to be a 3 month long movie some parts had to "wind up on the cutting floor" as one poor soul commented. People just watch movies nowadays rather than "live" them, understand them, try to find out what the message was. This movie showed soul, it moves me every time I watch it.$
a film of Ridley Scott. impressive because it is one of his films. touching because it could be an embroidery of memories about growing up and adventures on sea and Dead Poets Society or, maybe, the flavor of Moby Dick. more important - the powerful images, the puzzle of lives of young man, Jeff Bridges who does an impeccable job, the discover of yourself, the force and fragility and not comfortable decisions and the ocean as the lead character. the axis - maybe the nostalgia of viewer. because it is the story of public. dreams and memories and desires. Riddley Scott gives not only a great story about life and responsibilities giving sense and transforming, but propose a story from yourself. this does White Squall special.$
Well, maybe it isn't that bad. Some moments are touching, others genuinely harrowing. And Jeff Bridges always comes up with something surprising. But, "true story" though it may be, "White Squall" is overwhelmed by its obvious schematic and Ridley Scott's signature gloss. Each young crewmember has a stamped-on singular defect, Scott Wolf's tomcruisy precociousness is particularly grating, and for all the magnificent ocean scenery and blather about boys being forged into men, we're shown precious little of the day-to-day grunt/teamwork that's at the core of the whole business. Add to this the greatest assemblage of immaculate white t-shirts and bronzed, hairless torsos since Abercrombie met Fitch, and a potentially gritty, moving story lies trapped in amber.$
This movie for me is incredible! Since I like Sea and sailing boats a lot this movie is just right movie for me (like Master And Commander with Russel Crowe)and I believe for many others who likes Sea and sailing. This movie presents happy and sad story at the same time. I am delighted with characters of boys and others, with they relationship and killing the dolphin was something terrible. Everyone of boys has own big problems and we can describe that on the way what Chuck said: "Some of us are here for discipline, some for escape. And the rest don't even know why. I'm not sure where I fit in, but I can see a small piece of myself in each of them. I think I'll have friends here, and I hope this will be home." Very beautiful what he said, right? Ohh yes, and sound effects in movie are excellent in my opinion. I was enjoying the movie with great pleasure!$
What this film is, is basically a hybrid of "Dead Poets Society", and "The Poseiden Adventure".  Jeff Bridges leads a group of boys on a ship where they learn, as well as do vigorous physical exercises.  Of course every boy has some problem, let it be grades arn't high enough, or fear of heights, or problems with parents.  The cast is very good, but the script is rather weak, leaving the film rather uninvolving.  Still its usually entertaining, and all of the ocean water is refreshing to look at.  I'll give it a 6.5/10.$
This is one of my favourite movies ever. Good acting and storyline. A classic$
I love this movie.  It is one of the saddest I have ever seen.  Whenever I need a good cry, I watch this one.  This role of Gil is one of Ryan Phillippe's best so far.  Scott Wolf was wonderfully intense in it too as Chuck.  Most of the other men actors were wonderful in their roles also. Jeff Bridges' presence and all-knowing character truly completes the movie. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!$
Insipid story from Felix Sutton's book about young boys in the early 1960s who sign onto skipper/teacher Jeff Bridges' ship to hopefully build their characters (do teenage boys of any era really feel concerned about their characters?). Everyone naturally gets more than they bargained for once the ship is ravaged by a tropical storm. Teeth-grinding formula right off the assembly-line, saddled with inert juveniles and Bridges' hamming about. Pretentious, portentous and deadening. Directed by a slumming Ridley Scott, who may have overdosed on a late-night double-feature of "Dead Poets Society" and "Lord of the Flies". * from ****$
it is far to be original. or one of great films. it is decent. and, maybe, for a part of its public, useful, touching and a form of lesson about life with few pink ingredients. it could be a good occasion to discover few actors at young age or Jeff Bridges in a bitter role but, in same measure, to remind old fashion values and few cultural references, the spirit of teenagers and a good guide who transforms theirs in men. it reminds many other films about the same theme but the manner is almost a virtue. because it is a right work, with not the best end but the tension, the drops of soap opera, the pieces from the epics about the man against nature, the importance of duty and the metamorphose in contact with a great challenge are the solid good points.$
An under-rated movie. An excellent cast. An amazing story of one way for young men to grow and mature- if you survive. One of the best adaptations of a true story I have ever seen. Very emotional to watch the Squall and the final Court scenes. It made me research the story after seeing it. Would not hesitate to see it again.$
The film is entertaining, and the White squall part is excellent. However, the film is slow in spots, and drags it down from a 7.  Jeff Bridges is a good actor, and I like him in this film.  The end the film is a bit of a downer, but where would the interest be if no tragedy occurred.  Worth watching on TV. 6 or 7 out of 10.$

Dunston Checks In (1996)$
This film is obviously never going to be a monumental classic for all time, but it's quite underrated just the same. The story is simple. A four star hotel (run by Alexander, who lives there with his two sons) is up for a prestigious fifth star in the ratings guide when a jewel thief comes to visit, utilizing an orangutan as his accomplice. The fire-breathing owner turns on the heat to succeed while all hell breaks loose thanks to the primate. There seems to be something for everyone in it. The film begins with a lot of class as the various accoutrements of the hotel are featured. Kids should adore the orangutan "Dunston" and be able to identify with young Lloyd as his pal. Seinfeld fans should enjoy watching Alexander face all sorts of turmoil and hubbub as the harried hotel manager. Everett is comic in a grand, old-style sort of way with wrinkles, false teeth and a very threatening cane. There are a number of very talented supporting players who add to the comedic flair of the movie (Shadix, Bassey.) Even former "Pee Wee" Reubens has a cameo as a very aggressive exterminator. The end-all, be-all, though, is Dunaway. As the Leona Helmsley-esque, ultra-demanding, hyper-glamorous hotel owner, she walks off with the film and shows a rare funny side. It's not every day you see Dunaway with pink cake and icing all over her face. She cuts loose with a game, vivid, aware comedic performance which echoes all the neurotic, bitchy roles she used to play, but gave up after the stigma of "Mommie Dearest" wouldn't wear off. Somehow this missed at the box office, but it is perfect family entertainment for home video.$
This is one of the finest films I have ever seen.  Jason Alexander, Faye Dunaway, and Rupert Evert are all brilliant actors who make this thing work. Paul Reubens puts in a hilarious performance as the crazy animal control specialist La Farge.  I guarantee than anyone who sees this movie will laugh from start to finish at all the monkey-mayhem created by Dunston, the lovable but mischievous orangutan.  Everyone should see this movie.$
Centered around a hotel and a genius wild monkey befriending a boy. Very enjoyable even for adults! Jason Alexander is great too! Family films are a perfect landmark of heart and coziness.$
The story goes like this--Robert Grant (Jason Alexander) is a father to two kids, Kyle Grant (Eric Lloyd) and Brian (Graham Sack). He is the Manager of a hotel that's owned by Mrs. Dubrow (Faye Dunaway) and she promises Robert of some days holiday and a hike in pay and scale if he can convince a visiting undercover reviewer that their hotel is suited to be 6 star. Here enters into the frame Lord Rutledge (Rupert Everett), a thug and crook with intention of stealing jewelry and along with him comes his partner - an orangutan named Dunston!! All the drama unravels when Dunston tries to get out of Rutledge's world of crime and in his mission he gets help from Kyle and Brian. Of course the most appealing part of the film is the Orangutan. He really looks cool and has performed superbly . The other guy who adds an element of humour to the story is Lionel Spalding (Glenn Shadix), the real undercover reviewer. Overall, the film is simple, a bit humorous with no exceptional performances. You only watch this movie for the monkey as apart from that there is nothing new to watch out for in this movie. You can give it a miss if you are expecting a bit too much !!!$
When I tell people this is one of my favorite movies, they look at me as though I'm nuts. Okay, Citizen Kane it ain't, but even after repeat viewings I still laugh out loud. Pure escapism; who hasn't wanted to have an entire luxury hotel as a private playground? The "villains" are larger than life (terribly polite Rupert Everett as the monkey-abusing jewel thief, plus Faye Dunaway all but waving a wire hanger as the ultimate Evil Boss), the kids are cute without being gooey, and Jason Alexander does a good job as the hotel manager, playing it straight but enjoying the ride (the long climactic scene, with a mano-a-mano fight in the hotel kitchen, is the closest thing to a live cartoon). Hiss as mean Lord Rutledge threatens the monkey! Cheer as the fat guy falls on top of a frosting-smeared Dunaway! Laugh as the crazy red ape dresses up in lingerie and blows kisses at himself!$
Ignore negative ratings this is a fine movie.Ignore the haters, negative ratings. This is one of my all time favourite$
Dunston Checks In is nothing short of a masterpiece. The film is so dense with layers upon layers of meaning, so finely crafted and worked into the movie. The film's message is greatly abstract, but still somehow manages to stray away from being pretentious. The plot presents many complicated issues, and handles them with great care, making viewers question their own morals. The film is not afraid to present tough subject matters, and shows them in a light that perfectly indicates what the film is trying to say without trying to pander to a certain demographic, yet staying on the gray line. The film's acting is glorious, with an outstanding performance by Jason Alexander. Alexander absolutely pushes boundaries and shows the peak of his performance in an overwhelmingly powerful scene, where his character breaks down on the verge of tears. The cinematography is absolutely stunning, each shot has so much meaning, and without even saying a single word perfectly sets the tone communicates what is happening in the scene. It is difficult to put into words how magnificent this film is, so I highly recommend this film to those who have yet to see it. In short, this movie is a masterpiece. also the monkey is funny.$
...and nothing more. Because it is one of many easy comedies, just for fun, vulgar in few scenes, full of slapstick humor , proposing good actors in sketches of roles, proposing a sort of moral lesson. Sure, it is the film of orangutan. Who gives a total show. In rest , Faye Dunaway can be the only surprise. Rupert Everett gives one of his comedian roles with little tools and jason Alexander is the father in middle of a great "war". So, maybe nice.$
This film is certainly not Oscar material - far from it and I am sure that was not the producers intention.  However, judging from the small number of votes cast  an comments made for this film it seems like it has not been widely seen. It is an excellent family film with enough slapstick to keep the children happy but plenty for adults too.  I have seen a lot worse comedies that have been hailed as masterpieces.  All the performances are excellent and as usual Rupert Everett dominates every scene he is in.$
This is an intellectual masterpiece will an astonishing plot and colorful characters this is a true 10/10.$
I have seen this movie it was a great movie. Sam as Dunston the orangutan was very cute. Jason Alexander as Robert Grant was very good at this film. Eric Loyd as Kyle Grant was very nice in this film. Paul Rebuns (pee wee) as Buck LaFarge was funny. Faye Dunaway as Mrs, Dubrow was very beautiful. Whats sad that Dunston has a piece of glass on his hand. Dunston was scared about his hand. Whats terrible that Dunston does not have Samson anymore. Jennifer Bassey as Mrs. Dellacroce was very nice. Glenn Shadix as Lionel Spalding is funny. Rupert Everett as Lord Rutledge was very interesting That movie is funny, cute, and great you will like this movie so does Dunston the orangutan.$
i just love this movie! it is so funny, and such a great film for kids AND adults. it is way underrated. i seriously think that anyone would enjoy this movie because in my heart, it's an instant classic! DUNSTON LIVES FOREVER!$
I first saw this movie when it came out with my kids. Looking for stuff to watch during the pandemic and came across it and have not laughed this hard in quite a while. Was sad to see the monkey had died in 2010. He was well-trained a barrel of laughs.$
I've just seen this movie tonight as it was shown on Malaysia TV. It totally rocks! It was touching and funny at the same time. I loved Sam's (Dunston) acting. He was like so professional! Even better than some human actors. Lol. Anyway, I strongly recommend this movie to people who hadn't watched it, even though it's already 7 years since it first came out. And may I add that Eric Lloyd was so adorable in it! :)$

Black Sheep (1996)$
There are many words to describe "Black Sheep", and most of them begin with "un" - as in unsophisticated, uninspired, unoriginal. Still, it has some scattershot laughs. Gary Busey, for example, is brilliantly cast as a paranoid Vietnam veteran and comes through with the funniest performance by far. Chris Farley has barely one or two mildly funny moments in the entire film, but he does achieve some touching ones, and his honest efforts to amuse his audience in any way he can at least earn your respect. (**)$
I like this movie. It's a gripping political drama with a few laughs on the side$
While many critics did not like the comedy duo of Chris Farley and David Spade I thought those guys were funny and while 1995's "Tommy Boy" was panned miserably by critics I thought that film was hilarious. Since that film did well at the box office director Penelope Spheeris who made the hilarious "Wayne's World", lost her directing skills a little bit with "The Beverly Hillbillies", and improved once again with a 90's version of "The Little Rascals" thought it would be a good idea to re-team the comedy duo for another film that would be released almost a year after "Tommy Boy". Boy did she make a HUGE mistake. This film makes "The Beverly Hillbillies" look like "Citizen Kane"! The story of how I got to watch "Black Sheep" was after I saw "Tommy Boy" and loved it I took a trip to Blockbuster and picked this up. I thought it would be hilarious the storyline seemed funny but there was not one part in this film I laughed at. If you don't know even Gene Siskel before he died said this was the only film he ever walked out on in a theater since "Million Dollar Duck" in 1971 which forced Roger Ebert to say "boy Gene I envy you". So do I Mr. Siskel and I typically listen to audiences not critics. But I should have listened to you in this case. I even turned this off immediately and turned it back to Blockbuster because it sucked so much. An embarrassing waste of talent. If you need something to watch with Farley try his next film after this called "Beverly Hills Ninja" it is hilarious. If you under any circumstances see "Black Sheep" I will never recommend a good film to you again.$
GREAT comedy!!!!! I loved Tommy Boy with Chris Farley and David Spade in, and this is fantastic too! Great storyline too! Basically Al Donally is running for Governer and he wants to keep his accident-prone brother Mike (Farley) out of the way! So Al's new top adviser Steve Dodds (Spade) tries to keep Mike under wraps until after the election! Needless to say everything goes pear-shaped and you don't have to be a genius to work out the ending. But this is funny, light-hearted stuff and I laughed out loud loads of times throughout the movie! Great story, Great stars, Great film!$
Black Sheep is one of the most hilarious movies I have seen... I am a big Farley, Spade fan and this is just as funny as Tommy Boy... no one does it better then Farley when it comes to physical humor, and the dry humor that David Spade delivers is knee slapping funny... I definitely recommend this movie!$
I first watched Black Sheep in 2002. I was 11 and literally could not sit through the whole film. The pacing was slow, Farley kept falling down all the time and Spade essentially was just playing his same role from Tommy Boy all over again. Even though I liked Tommy Boy I hated this and many claim they are the same movie but I felt this was much inferior. Six years later I caught this again on Comedy Central and my opinion had not changed. I shut it off halfway through. Reading a biography on the late, great Chris Farley which was written by his brother, I made it a mission to rewatch all of the work he left us in the short time he was here, and rewatching Tommy Boy and laughing out loud all over again inspired me to give this one more try. Well I am much older now so maybe I got the jokes better because this was actually a lot of fun and quite funny. Of course still inferior to Tommy Boy but certainly a masterpiece compared to Farley's final film, Almost Heroes. While there are many similarities to this and Tommy Boy there are also quite a few differences. Although not as moving as his relationship with Brian Dennehy as his father in Tommy Boy, Farley does have some nice and heartwarming chemistry with Tim Matheson as his brother who is running for governor. That was inspired casting of course. Farley loved Animal House and idolized John Belushi so it would only be natural to get a star from the comedy classic to be his brother. Farley and Spade's chemistry this time is just as good as in Tommy Boy. The writing and jokes are very funny. I think this is slightly inferior to the aforementioned film because this relies much more on slapstick where the aforementioned had plenty but also had a lot of heart. While this did not have as much heart as Tommy Boy, there was still plenty to keep things afloat and enjoyable. A couple bonus points for this one include Gary Busey's hilarious supporting role and Christine Ebersole (Macaulay Culkin's mom in Richie Rich) makes a fine villian in the role of the incumbent governor opposing Matheson. She makes Bo Derek, Rob Lowe and Dan Aykroyd's villians from Tommy Boy all look kind in comparison. The pacing is actually just fine if you keep up with the jokes. The bat in the cabin scene where Farley and Spade try to rid of the bat is a hilarious highlight as well as Farley's visit to Matheson's appearance at an MTV Rock the Vote concert. This was directed by Penelope Spheeris who gave us her finest directorial effort with Wayne's World. Though she doesn't have as firm a grasp on this material as Peter Segal did with Tommy Boy this proves to be her next best work after Wayne's World and has some truly equally goofy memorable moments and dialogue. While I wish Chris Farley were still around to make more movies I can now say by giving this another chance, this one is to be celebrated among the finest work he did give us while he was here. Not as quotable or with as much heart as Tommy Boy but still one fun, likeable movie with many funny scenes, good performances and funny lines. Pair this with Tommy Boy for a double feature and celebrate the great work that the late Chris Farley left before his premature, tragic demise. God bless you Chris. We miss you man, and always will. Thanks for all the laughs buddy. Keep them going in Heaven.$
Chris Farley was a genuinely funny bloke capable of making people laugh to the point of tears. David Spade is one of the great wimp/smart-guy actors of this generation, and teaming the two of them up formed a comedy duo that could have been bigger than any other in history (had in not been for Farley's death). Spade had a heap of respect for Farley, in a recent interview when asked about losing Chris Spade said something along the lines "he was a great guy to work with, and now I guess I'm on my own". This movie was exceptionally hilarious, Some unforgettable scenes such as the head-banging in the car and the house collapsing after the roof was taken off by the wind. I have to give a ten-er, is was brilliant and displays two of the great comedy-actors doing what they do best in roles they best portray. See it peoples!!!!!$
Black Sheep has to be one of the worst movies I've ever seen and shamelessly rips off the previous teaming between Spade and Farley, Tommy Boy.  While Tommy Boy has some funny moments that show originality (Herbie Hancock gets me everytime) Black Sheep tries to rely on Farley's endless pratfalls and stupidity.  David Spade, on the other hand, provides sarcasm that isn't funny at all.  Overall, pretty dumb and desperate attempt at comedy.  If you want to see something funny and original, rent This is Spinal Tap or Young Frankenstein instead.$
Black Sheep (1996): Dir: Penelope Spheeris / Cast: Chris Farley, David Spade, Tim Matheson, Gary Busey, Christine Ebersole: Chris Farley and David Spade reunite under a false or sense of error in one's lifestyle. This is their second pairing, after starring in the dreadful Tommy Boy. One can say that their followup is strike two. Farley attempts to help his brother's campaign but he messes up constantly. Spade is assigned to keep him out of trouble and together they uncover a conspiracy. Routine comedy with little plot. Director Penelope Spheeris does her best particularly during scene in a cabin, but after directing Wayne's World this is a big step down. Farley is still doing the nightclub act although not as annoying as he is in Tommy Boy. Spade is stranded with a deadpan role just as he was in Tommy Boy. This is also a major waste of time for Tim Matheson as Farley's brother, especially after his sheer hilarity as a fraternity brother in National Lampoon's Animal House. Also featured is Gary Busey much to his dismay, and Christine Ebersole who has the misfortune of being stuck under a thrashing Farley. One can only hope their career will outlast decisions to appear in films as stupid as this one. This film exists for stupid humour setups such as Farley thrashing atop a woman after being immobilized on top of her. Very forced and not worth the time of day. Score: 3 / 10$
this movie was the best it was a great "follow-up" to Tommy Boy even though both movies had nothing to do w/ each other, had not the same story line or resemblance, not the same characters,etc. Black Sheep was great, but had kinda cheesy acting by David Spade especially when he was on that huge rock and he was trying to get a signal....that was great and hilarious, but like when he fell he made a sound thats not...right sorta i don't know. The movie was great and i know all of u have to agree that the cabin scene was the most memorable! It was great when the hail started and then the roof collapsed and then the top bunk fell and i can go on and on and really movies like these makes Chris Farley very missed by his true Black Shhep, SNL, Tommy Boy, etc. films!!!$
